Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a culinary expert and strategist, breaking down the given recipe into subtasks and assigning each to the appropriate kitchen role. The dish is Roast Chicken with Lemon Herb Sauce, and there's a list of kitchen roles provided.

First, I need to understand the recipe steps thoroughly. The recipe has six main steps: preheating the oven, seasoning the chicken, searing, transferring to bake, making the sauce, and drizzling the sauce. Each step should be a subtask. Now, I need to map each of these steps to the correct kitchen role from the list provided.

Let me go through each step one by one.

1. **Preheat the oven to 375°F.** This is a basic task. The Rôtisseur is responsible for roasting, so preheating the oven would fall under their role. Makes sense because they manage the roasting station.

2. **Season the chicken with salt and pepper.** Seasoning is usually part of preparation. The Chef de partie oversees a specific station, but maybe the Boucher (butcher) prepares the meat. Wait, Boucher is more about butchering meat, but here the chicken is already being seasoned. Alternatively, the Cuisinier (cook) or Commis (junior cook) might handle this. Wait, the recipe is for a roast chicken, so maybe the Rôtisseur again? Because they handle roasting, which includes preparing the meat for roasting. Hmm, but seasoning might be a prep task. Alternatively, the Commis could handle basic prep tasks under supervision. Maybe the Rôtisseur would be in charge of seasoning since it's part of their station's responsibility.

3. **Sear the chicken in a hot pan until golden brown.** Searing is typically done on the stove. The Grillardin is responsible for grilling or searing items. So Grillardin would handle this step. That fits.

4. **Transfer the chicken to a baking dish and bake for 25 minutes.** This is part of the roasting process, so Rôtisseur again. They handle the oven roasting after searing.

5. **Prepare a sauce by simmering garlic, lemon, and herbs.** Sauces are the domain of the Saucier. So the Saucier would handle making the lemon herb sauce.

6. **Drizzle the sauce over the chicken before serving.** This could be done by the Saucier again, or perhaps the Chef de cuisine for final plating. But drizzling sauce is part of saucier's role, so maybe Saucier does this.

Now, checking the kitchen roles again to ensure I'm assigning correctly. The roles include Rôtisseur, Grillardin, Saucier, etc. The Chef de cuisine is the head chef, who might oversee but not do the hands-on tasks. The Sous-chef assists. The Commis is a junior role, maybe assisting in prep. But in this recipe, the steps seem to require more specialized roles.

Wait, step 2: seasoning the chicken. If the Rôtisseur is responsible for roasting, they might season the meat as part of their preparation. Alternatively, the Boucher (butcher) might prepare the meat, but seasoning is more about cooking prep. So Rôtisseur makes sense here.

Let me verify the roles:

- Rôtisseur: Roast cook, handles roasting and related tasks.
- Grillardin: Grill cook, handles searing/grilling.
- Saucier: Sauce cook.
- Commis: Junior cook, helps with prep.
- Chef de partie: Station chef, in charge of a specific section.

But in a professional kitchen, the Chef de partie might oversee a station, but the actual task might be done by the specific role. For example, the Rôtisseur is a type of Chef de partie (station chef) in charge of the roast station. So maybe assigning to Rôtisseur directly.

So final assignments:

1. Preheat oven: Rôtisseur
2. Season chicken: Rôtisseur (since it's part of prepping the roast)
3. Sear chicken: Grillardin
4. Transfer and bake: Rôtisseur
5. Prepare sauce: Saucier
6. Drizzle sauce: Saucier

That covers all steps. Each role is appropriately assigned based on their specialty. The Chef de cuisine might oversee but isn't assigned to specific tasks here. The other roles like Commis could assist, but the main tasks are handled by the specialized roles.<answer>
1. **Preheat the oven to 375°F**  
   - **Assigned to**: Rôtisseur (roast cook, responsible for oven management and roasting tasks).  

2. **Season the chicken with salt and pepper**  
   - **Assigned to**: Rôtisseur (handles meat preparation for roasting).  

3. **Sear the chicken in a hot pan until golden brown**  
   - **Assigned to**: Grillardin (grill/pan-sear specialist).  

4. **Transfer the chicken to a baking dish and bake for 25 minutes**  
   - **Assigned to**: Rôtisseur (oversees roasting execution).  

5. **Prepare a sauce by simmering garlic, lemon, and herbs**  
   - **Assigned to**: Saucier (sauce and sauté specialist).  

6. **Drizzle the sauce over the chicken before serving**  
   - **Assigned to**: Saucier (final saucing and plating support).

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand each subtask and who is responsible for what. The Rôtisseur handles the oven and roasting, the Grillardin is in charge of searing, and the Saucier makes the sauce.

Starting with task 1: Preheat the oven to 375°F. That's the Rôtisseur's job. So they'll turn on the oven and set the temperature. Then, task 2 is seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper, also done by the Rôtisseur. They'll take the chicken, season it all over. 

Next, task 3: Sear the chicken. The Grillardin will heat a pan, maybe add some oil, and sear the chicken until it's golden brown on all sides. Once that's done, task 4 is transferring the chicken to a baking dish and baking for 25 minutes. The Rôtisseur takes over again here, putting the seared chicken in the oven. They need to make sure the oven is at the right temp and set a timer.

While the chicken is baking, the Saucier starts on task 5: preparing the sauce. They'll simmer garlic, lemon, and herbs. Maybe they sauté the garlic first, then add lemon juice and herbs, let it reduce a bit. Timing is important here so the sauce is ready when the chicken is done. 

Once the chicken is baked, task 6 is drizzling the sauce over it before serving. The Saucier would finish by pouring the sauce over the chicken, maybe garnish with herbs for presentation. 

I need to check if all steps are followed correctly. Did each role do their part? The Rôtisseur preheated, seasoned, and baked. Grillardin seared. Saucier made and added the sauce. Seems right. The final dish should be a roasted chicken with a garlic-lemon herb sauce. Let me make sure each step is accounted for in the output.<answer>
**Final Cooked Meal:**  
**Herb-Roasted Chicken with Garlic-Lemon Pan Sauce**  

1. **Oven Management**: The Rôtisseur preheated the oven to 375°F.  
2. **Meat Preparation**: The Rôtisseur seasoned the chicken generously with salt and pepper.  
3. **Searing Execution**: The Grillardin seared the chicken in a hot pan until golden brown on all sides, creating a flavorful crust.  
4. **Roasting**: The Rôtisseur transferred the seared chicken to a baking dish and roasted it in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, ensuring it cooked to tender perfection.  
5. **Sauce Preparation**: The Saucier simmered minced garlic, fresh lemon juice, and aromatic herbs (e.g., thyme, rosemary) in a saucepan until the flavors melded into a bright, savory sauce.  
6. **Plating**: The Saucier drizzled the finished sauce over the roasted chicken just before serving, enhancing the dish with zesty, herbal notes.  

**Result**: A succulent, golden-brown roasted chicken with a crisp exterior and juicy interior, complemented by a fragrant garlic-lemon herb sauce.
