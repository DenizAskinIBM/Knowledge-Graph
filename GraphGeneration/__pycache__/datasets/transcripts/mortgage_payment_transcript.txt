Agent: Good morning, thank you for calling Montreal Dominion Bank. My name is Emily. How can I assist you today?

Client: Hi, this is Sarah speaking. I’m really frustrated right now. I have a variable-rate mortgage, and the interest rate went down last night. I was expecting my payments to go down as well, but they didn’t. What’s going on?

Agent: I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling frustrated, Sarah. I’d be happy to look into this for you and explain what’s happening. Let’s start by verifying some details about your mortgage. Can I confirm your mortgage account number and a few other details for security purposes?

Client: Sure, my mortgage account number is 12345678.

Agent: Thank you. And can you confirm your date of birth and the postal code associated with the account?

Client: It’s January 15, 1985, and the postal code is H3Z 1A2.

Agent: Perfect, thank you for that. I’ve accessed your account. Before I explain, I want to assure you that I’ll do my best to clarify everything. Variable-rate mortgages can sometimes be a bit tricky.

Client: Well, I hope so, because this is really confusing. I thought lower rates meant lower payments.

Agent: I completely understand how it can seem that way. With your specific variable-rate mortgage, your payments are actually structured a bit differently. While the interest rate affects how much of your payment goes toward the principal versus interest, the total payment amount itself doesn’t always change immediately when rates fluctuate.

Client: What do you mean?

Agent: Let me break it down. In your case, you have what’s called a fixed payment variable-rate mortgage. That means your monthly payment amount remains constant, even as the interest rate changes. When rates go down, a larger portion of your payment goes toward reducing the principal balance, while less goes toward paying interest.

Client: So, my payment doesn’t change at all?

Agent: That’s correct. The benefit is that you’ll pay down your mortgage faster when rates decrease because more of your payment goes toward the principal.

Client: Oh, I see. But if that’s the case, why wasn’t this explained to me when I signed up for this mortgage?

Agent: I understand how you feel, Sarah, and I apologize if that wasn’t made clear during the initial setup. It’s definitely something we try to explain to all our clients, but I know these details can sometimes get lost. If you’d like, I can also arrange for a follow-up meeting with one of our mortgage specialists to review your options.

Client: No, I think I understand now. It’s just a lot to take in.

Agent: I completely get that. To recap, your payments aren’t decreasing, but you’re actually benefiting by paying off your mortgage faster whenever rates drop. And if you’d like, I can send you an updated amortization schedule so you can see how your balance is being paid down.

Client: That would be helpful, thank you.

Agent: You’re very welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Client: No, that clears things up. Thanks for taking the time to explain everything.

Agent: It’s my pleasure, Sarah. Thank you for choosing MD Bank. Have a great day!

Client: You too.
