Myocardial Perfusion Imaging | Stanford Health Care Your heart muscle needs a steady flow of blood to function well and stay healthy. Myocardial perfusion imaging is a noninvasive method for evaluating this blood flow. We also use the scans to look for damage after a heart attack and to determine if previous treatment has helped. While perfusion assessment may reqire you to exercise, the testing process is safe and painless. What is Myocardial Perfusion Imaging?

What is Myocardial Perfusion Imaging? (with pictures) What is Myocardial Perfusion Imaging? A patient with shortness of breath and chest pains may need myocardial perfusion imaging. Abnormal results on an electrocardiogram test often require further testing, such as with myocardial perfusion imaging. A patient may experience chest discomfort following myocardial perfusion imaging. Pregnancy can interfere with a myocardial perfusion imaging test. Following myocardial perfusion imaging, some may experience nausea, fatigue and headaches. Scar tissue resulting from a heart attack can be seen by myocardial perfusion imaging. An abnormal electrocardiogram may indicate the need for myocardial perfusion imaging. A person may experience nausea after a myocardial perfusion imaging
Answer: Myocardial perfusion imaging is beneficial prior to angiography as it is a noninvasive method for evaluating blood flow to the heart muscle. It helps in assessing the blood flow, looking for damage after a heart attack, and determining if previous treatments have been effective. This imaging can provide valuable information that may guide the need for further invasive procedures like angiography.

Answer: Myocardial perfusion imaging offers several benefits prior to angiography. It is a noninvasive method for evaluating blood flow to the heart muscle, which helps in assessing the heart's health and function. This imaging can identify areas of the heart that may have been damaged by a heart attack and determine the effectiveness of previous treatments. Additionally, it can help in diagnosing the cause of symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pains, and it is often used when there are abnormal results on an electrocardiogram. By providing detailed information about blood flow and heart muscle function, myocardial perfusion imaging can guide further treatment decisions, potentially reducing the need for more invasive procedures like angiography.

Answer: The real meaning of education is not solely dependent on the availability of supplies in and out of the classroom. While having more resources can enhance the learning experience, true education involves a comprehensive understanding of various factors, including the development of skills, critical thinking, and the ability to apply knowledge in real-world situations. As highlighted in the context from Century College, unique learning opportunities such as traveling, service learning, and credit for prior learning can significantly contribute to achieving the full potential of education.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-sarcoidosis-treatment

How Do I Know If I Have Sarcoidosis?

If your doctor suspects sarcoidosis, they will do the following:

Review your medical history

Perform a physical exam

Order chest X-rays and blood tests that may aid in the diagnosis

In 90% of people with sarcoidosis, chest X-rays show abnormalities. Bloodwork cannot be used to diagnose sarcoidosis, but you may see a low white count (5% - 10%), high calcium in the blood or urine, and elevated ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) levels and inflammatory markers.

Your doctor may also order pulmonary function tests, which measure how well your lungs are working. If the symptoms are severe enough, your doctor will likely recommend a tissue biopsy. They will be looking for non-necrotizing granulomas (clumps of immune cells), or other diseases, which may resemble sarcoidosis on a chest X-ray.

Key figures in the movement included Eduardo Paolozzi, Peter Blake, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Indiana, and Robert Rauschenberg. The movement became one of the most recognizable art forms, celebrated for its ironic take on "high art" values.

Answer: Yes, it could be dangerous for a human being to have direct contact with imidazolium-based ionic liquids in the context of occupational exposure. Although ionic liquids are often considered environmentally friendly, their safety has been questioned due to their potential as cytotoxic agents. The interactions between ionic liquids and cells are not fully understood, but studies have shown that imidazolium-based ionic liquids can significantly distort biomimetic membranes and promote vesicle rupture, indicating potential harmful effects. Therefore, appropriate safety measures should be taken to minimize exposure.

Answer: To promote dignity and respect in care, you can focus on the following key actions:

1. **Treat Individuals as You Would Expect to be Treated**: Ensure that all interactions with residents are conducted with the same level of respect and care that you would want for yourself.

2. **Understand and Implement Dignified Care**: Be trained and knowledgeable about what constitutes dignified care, ensuring that all actions and decisions support and promote a person's self-respect.

3. **Monitor and Maintain High Standards**: Leaders should regularly monitor staff to ensure that the highest standards of dignified care are being met consistently.

4. **Focus on Small, Meaningful Actions**: Recognize that small, seemingly inconsequential actions can have a significant impact on a person's dignity, especially when they have relinquished much of their independence.

5. **Promote Self-Respect**: Ensure that care practices do not undermine a person's self-respect, but rather support and enhance it.

By incorporating these practices, care settings can effectively promote dignity and respect for all individuals.

Answer: To promote dignity and respect in care, it is important to focus on several key factors that contribute to a person's sense of self-respect. Here are some strategies:

1. **Understand and Implement the SCIE 8 Point Dignity Challenge**: This involves ensuring that all aspects of care promote dignity and respect. Staff should be trained to treat residents as they would expect to be treated themselves.

2. **Provide Dignified Care**: Care should support and promote a person's self-respect. This involves small, seemingly inconsequential actions that can have a significant impact on someone who has given up much of their independence.

3. **Training and Monitoring**: Ensure that all staff are trained to understand how to provide dignified care and are monitored by their leaders to maintain high standards.

4. **Empathy and Respect**: Encourage staff to empathize with residents and treat them with the utmost respect, recognizing their individuality and personal needs.

By focusing on these strategies, care settings can create an environment that upholds dignity and respect for all individuals.

GraphRAG Score: 5Question: Why does the word "no" itself not exist in chinese?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Whilst 不 (bù) can be said to be the closest translation to saying no in Chinese, it tends not to be used by itself. An important rule to follow when saying no in Chinese is to add 没 (méi) or 不 (bù) in front of a verb or verb clause. When the verb is 有 (yǒu) then the ‘no’ response is 没有 (méi yǒu), otherwise, 不 (bù) is used.

Just as in other languages, there are several different ways for us to use the word no in Chinese, it’s not just to refuse or disagree. You can also learn how to say yes in Chinese in our article, Try These Different Ways to Say Yes in Chinese.

Below are the various ways, with examples, to use no in Chinese.

1. To Disagree with a Statement or Question

不 / 不是 / 不对 / 不用了

Use these examples to disagree with something or someone’s opinion:

不 (bù) no

不，我不想去。(bù, wǒ bù xiǎng qù) No, I don’t want to go.

不是 (bú shì) no / is not

他是美国人吗？(tā shì měi guó rén ma?) Is he American?

不是。 他是英国人。(bú shì, tā shì yīng guó rén) No, he’s British.

不对 (bú duì) not right / incorrect

The phrase 对不对 is good to use when checking information or facts, it means ‘am I right or not?’:

他是老师， 对不对？(tā shì lǎo shī, duì bú duì) She’s a teacher, right?

不对， 他是翻译。(bú duì, tā shì fān yì) No, he’s a translator.

不用了 (bù yòng le) no need

不用了 can be used to refuse something offered to you, such as a bag in a grocery store, or help from a person.

不用了，谢谢。(bù yòng le, xiè xie) No, thanks.

没 (méi) / 没有 (méi yǒu) to not be

没 negates the verb 有 meaning ‘to have’, so in the following examples, 没 is used instead of 不. In some situations, 有 can be removed from the sentence, although using 没有 would still be correct.

你回家了吗？ (nǐ huí jiā le ma?) Did you go home?

没有，我还在学校。(méi yǒu, wǒ hái zài xué xiào) No, I am still at school.

家里一个人都没有。(jiā lǐ yī gè rén dōu méi yǒu) There is no one at home.

他没钱。(tā méi qián) He has no money.

别 / 不要 / 不可以 / 不行

These examples can simply be used to refuse something when offered it or to emphasise that you don’t want something to happen.

别 ( bié) don’t / must not

我要扔了它！(wǒ yào rēng le tā) I will throw it away！

别！(bié) (不要!) No！

别担心。(bié dān xīn) No worries.

不要 (bù yào) (bú yào) to not want

你要不要喝咖啡吗？(nǐ yào bù yào hē kā fēi ma?) Do you want some coffee?

不要， 谢谢。(bù yào, xiè xie) No, thanks.

我要走了。(wǒ yào zǒu le) I have to go.

不要！(bù yào) 别走！No!

不可以 (bù kě yǐ) cannot

不可以 and 不能 can be used to deny or refuse a request:

我可不可以抽烟吗？(wǒ kě bù kě yǐ chōu yān ma?) Can I smoke?

不可以。(bù kě yǐ) No.

无 (wú) No

无人知晓。(wú rén zhī xiǎo) No one knows.

2. To Express Shock or Surprise

不可能 / 不是吧 / 是吗 / 真的(吗)

Imagine someone told you a good piece of gossip. You might reply with ‘NO!’

The following examples put emphasis on the ‘no’ response.

不可能 (bù kě néng) no / impossible

不可能 (bù kě néng) is a way of saying no with emphasis.

别等了，她不会来了。(bié děng le, tā bù huì lái le) Don‘t wait anymore, she’s not coming.

不可能！ 她会来的！(bù kě néng! tā huì lái de) No! She will!

不是吧 ！(bú shì ba) No way

他输了！(tā shū le) He lost！

不是吧！(bú shì ba) No way！

3. To Disallow and Prohibit

禁止… / 不准…

禁止 (jìn zhǐ) to prohibit

This example is mainly found in written Chinese and can be seen on signs around China to warn people not to do certain activities.

禁止入内 (jìn zhǐ rù nèi) No entrance

不准 (bù zhǔn) not to allow

不准停车 (bù zhǔn tíng chē) No parking!

How to say No in Chinese. 15 ways to say No in Mandarin Chinese

Saying 'no' can be a challenge in any language, but it's especially important in Mandarin Chinese where the culture places a high value on politeness and avoiding conflict. In this article, we will explore 15 different ways to say 'no' in Chinese, ranging from straightforward rejections to more nuanced expressions. Whether you're a language learner, a traveler, or simply seeking to expand your vocabulary, this guide will give you the tools you need to communicate your boundaries effectively in Mandarin. From basic phrases to idiomatic expressions, learn how to decline invitations, reject requests, and say 'no' with confidence in any situation.

In Mandarin Chinese, the word for no is 不 (bù). It can be used in a variety of situations to indicate that the answer to a question or request is negative.

For example:

• Q: 你要喝茶吗？(nǐ yào hē chá ma?) - Do you want to drink tea?

• A: 不要 (bù yào) - No, I don't want to.

It is also common to use 不 in conjunction with other words or phrases to indicate a negative response in a more polite or indirect manner. For example:

• Q: 你明天去不去？(nǐ míng tiān qù bù qù?) - Are you going tomorrow?

• A: 不去 (bù qù) - No, I'm not going.

In Mandarin Chinese, 不 is often used on its own to express negation in informal conversation. Sometimes, it's considered impolite to simply say 不 without any explanation or additional words. In more formal or polite situations, it's more appropriate to use more indirect or polite ways of indicating a negative response.

2. 不是 (bù shì)

3. 没有 (méi yǒu)

4. 不要 (bù yào)

5. 不可以 (bù kě yǐ)

Answer: In Chinese, the word "no" itself does not exist as a standalone word because the language structure and cultural context emphasize politeness and indirect communication. Instead of a single word for "no," Chinese uses negation particles like 不 (bù) and 没 (méi) in combination with verbs or verb clauses to express negation. This approach allows for more nuanced and context-specific expressions of disagreement or refusal, aligning with the cultural value of avoiding direct confrontation and maintaining harmony in communication.

From basic phrases to idiomatic expressions, learn how to decline invitations, reject requests, and say \'no\' with confidence in any situation.\\n\\nIn Mandarin Chinese, the word for no is 不 (bù). It can be used in a variety of situations to indicate that the answer to a question or request is negative.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n• Q: 你要喝茶吗？(nǐ yào hē chá ma?) - Do you want to drink tea?\\n\\n• A: 不要 (bù yào) - No, I don\'t want to.\\n\\nIt is also common to use 不 in conjunction with other words or phrases to indicate a negative response in a more polite or indirect manner.

Tt is common to only use 不 (bù) as the answer to express no in Mandarin Chinese. This is especially the case in casual conversations, where the use of a single word response like 不 is acceptable and easily understood\\n\\nFor example, if someone asks 你要喝茶吗?

Do you want to drink beer?\\n\\nB: 不要。(bù yào) No, I don\'t want to.\\n\\n5. 不可以 (bù kě yǐ)\\n\\n不可以 (bù kě yǐ) is a phrase in Mandarin Chinese that means cannot or not allowed.

Answer: In Chinese, the word "no" itself does not exist as a standalone word because the language typically uses negation in conjunction with verbs or verb clauses to express a negative response. The closest translation to "no" is 不 (bù), but it is not commonly used by itself. Instead, Chinese uses 不 (bù) or 没 (méi) before verbs to indicate negation. For example, 不 (bù) is used with most verbs, while 没 (méi) is used with the verb 有 (yǒu) to mean "not have." This structure reflects the language's emphasis on context and specificity in communication, rather than using a single word to convey negation.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/sugar

so your body has developed a number of systems to ensure this supply. For instance, the pancreas secretes a hormone called insulin that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood.



Insulin allows glucose to enter body cells. It also helps with the storage of excess glucose in the liver, which supplements blood glucose levels if they start to fall.

A person with diabetes has either insufficient or inefficient insulin, which means their blood glucose levels tend to be too high. There are 2 types of diabetes:

Type 2 diabetes is associated with overweight and obesity and can be controlled, or even reversed, through dietary modification.



A small amount of sugar is safe for people with diabetes

There is no evidence that a diet high in sugar directly causes either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, being overweight or obese is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and perhaps someone who is overweight might also eat a lot of sugar.

Early evidence shows that some people with type 2

more sensitive to insulin.

Become familiar with how your blood glucose responds to exercise. Checking your blood glucose level more often before and after exercise can help you see the benefits of activity. You also can use the results of your blood glucose checks to see how your body reacts to different activities. Understanding these patterns can help you prevent your blood glucose from going too high or too low.

Hypoglycemia and Physical Activity

People taking insulin or insulin secretagogues (oral diabetes pills that cause your pancreas to make more insulin) are at risk for hypoglycemia if insulin dose or carbohydrate intake is not adjusted with exercise. Checking your blood glucose before doing any physical activity is important to prevent hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Talk to your diabetes care team (doctor, nurse, dietitian, or pharmacist) to find out if you are at risk for hypoglycemia.

If you experience hypoglycemia during or after exercise, treat it

IP, and patents in particular, can add significant value to your business. Perhaps more important for funding purposes, patents also give your business the appearance of having value for a number of reasons.

Competitive advantage. If you’re in an innovative field, there’s no question that patents give your company a competitive market advantage. Start-ups that lack patents or other protected intellectual property can be seen as lacking any real ability to compete in the market, making them appear weaker and less desirable to investors.

The appearance of quality. Whether or not it’s true, when your innovations are patented, they appear to investors to be of higher quality. Higher quality products, in turn, make your company seem more valuable. When value can’t be easily measured, anything that gives the appearance of value helps your cause.

 https://timreview.ca/article/501

have confirmed a marked difference in IP focus between, for example, biotech or medical device startups and software startups (Graham et al., 2009; Greenberg, 2010). Biotech startups tend to consider patents as most important, whereas software startups tend to rely more on trade secrets, other forms of confidential information, and copyright. Both studies show that VC-funded startups, even in the software area, tend to file more patent applications than startups relying on other sources of funding. Clues to what form of IP is important to a particular technology sector may be found by observing what other companies are doing in the same technology sector.

Aspects of Patent Value

Initially, patenting costs may be a significant expense relative to costs of R&D and product commercialization. However, these costs must be evaluated relative to the potential commercial value of products or services embodying the invention, such as potential product revenues that a future patent may protect
Answer: Based on the provided context, a venture capitalist might choose to invest in a healthcare startup with no revenue but a highly coveted patent. Patents in innovative fields like healthcare can provide a competitive market advantage and give the appearance of higher quality and value to investors. This perceived value and potential for future revenue protection could make the startup more attractive to venture capitalists, even in the absence of current revenue.

Genu valgum, or knock-knee, is a condition where the knees touch but the ankles do not. It appears most frequently in young children and can be concerning for parents who may know little about the condition. Genu valgum is more commonly referred to as knock-knee. When someone with genu valgum stands with their knees together, there is a gap between the ankles of about 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) or more. The knees will appear to push in toward each other. It is most common in children, typically affecting 3- to 6-year-olds. In most young children, the condition will naturally correct itself by age 7 years. In rare cases, genu valgum may continue into adolescence. In other cases, older children or adults may develop it as a result of an underlying disease or condition.

RAG Score: 9
GraphRAG Score: 10Question: In the field relying on brain psychology, how do they know when the hypothesis is going to give a good result?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: A hypothesis is a tentative statement about the relationship between two or more variables. It is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to happen in a study.

One hypothesis example would be a study designed to look at the relationship between sleep deprivation and test performance might have a hypothesis that states: "This study is designed to assess the hypothesis that sleep-deprived people will perform worse on a test than individuals who are not sleep-deprived."

This article explores how a hypothesis is used in psychology research, how to write a good hypothesis, and the different types of hypotheses you might use.

The Hypothesis in the Scientific Method

In the scientific method, whether it involves research in psychology, biology, or some other area, a hypothesis represents what the researchers think will happen in an experiment. The scientific method involves the following steps:

Forming a question Performing background research Creating a hypothesis Designing an experiment Collecting data Analyzing the results Drawing conclusions Communicating the results

The hypothesis is a prediction, but it involves more than a guess. Most of the time, the hypothesis begins with a question which is then explored through background research. It is only at this point that researchers begin to develop a testable hypothesis. Unless you are creating an exploratory study, your hypothesis should always explain what you expect to happen.

In a study exploring the effects of a particular drug, the hypothesis might be that researchers expect the drug to have some type of effect on the symptoms of a specific illness. In psychology, the hypothesis might focus on how a certain aspect of the environment might influence a particular behavior.

Remember, a hypothesis does not have to be correct. While the hypothesis predicts what the researchers expect to see, the goal of the research is to determine whether this guess is right or wrong. When conducting an experiment, researchers might explore a number of factors to determine which ones might contribute to the ultimate outcome.

In many cases, researchers may find that the results of an experiment do not support the original hypothesis. When writing up these results, the researchers might suggest other options that should be explored in future studies.

Hypothesis Format

In many cases, researchers might draw a hypothesis from a specific theory or build on previous research. For example, prior research has shown that stress can impact the immune system. So a researcher might hypothesize: "People with high-stress levels will be more likely to contract a common cold after being exposed to the virus than people who have low-stress levels."

In other instances, researchers might look at commonly held beliefs or folk wisdom. "Birds of a feather flock together" is one example of folk wisdom that a psychologist might try to investigate. The researcher might pose a specific hypothesis that "People tend to select romantic partners who are similar to them in interests and educational level."

Elements of a Good Hypothesis

So how do you write a good hypothesis? When trying to come up with a hypothesis for your research or experiments, ask yourself the following questions:

Is your hypothesis based on your research on a topic?

Can your hypothesis be tested?

Does your hypothesis include independent and dependent variables?

Before you come up with a specific hypothesis, spend some time doing background research. Once you have completed a literature review, start thinking about potential questions you still have. Pay attention to the discussion section in the journal articles you read. Many authors will suggest questions that still need to be explored.

To form a hypothesis, you should take these steps:

Collect as many observations about a topic or problem as you can.

Evaluate these observations and look for possible causes of the problem.

Create a list of possible explanations that you might want to explore.

After you have developed some possible hypotheses, think of ways that you could confirm or disprove each hypothesis through experimentation. This is known as falsifiability.

Falsifiability of a Hypothesis

In the scientific method, falsifiability is an important part of any valid hypothesis.﻿﻿ In order to test a claim scientifically, it must be possible that the claim could be proven false.

Students sometimes confuse the idea of falsifiability with the idea that it means that something is false, which is not the case. What falsifiability means is that if something was false, then it is possible to demonstrate that it is false.

One of the hallmarks of pseudoscience is that it makes claims that cannot be refuted or proven false.

Operational Definitions

A variable is a factor or element that can be changed and manipulated in ways that are observable and measurable. However, the researcher must also define how the variable will be manipulated and measured in the study.

For example, a researcher might operationally define the variable "test anxiety" as the results of a self-report measure of anxiety experienced during an exam. A "study habits" variable might be defined by the amount of studying that actually occurs as measured by time.

These precise descriptions are important because many things can be measured in a number of different ways. One of the basic principles of any type of scientific research is that the results must be replicable.﻿﻿ By clearly detailing the specifics of how the variables were measured and manipulated, other researchers can better understand the results and repeat the study if needed.

Some variables are more difficult than others to define. How would you operationally define a variable such as aggression? For obvious ethical reasons, researchers cannot create a situation in which a person behaves aggressively toward others.

In order to measure this variable, the researcher must devise a measurement that assesses aggressive behavior without harming other people. In this situation, the researcher might utilize a simulated task to measure aggressiveness.

Hypothesis Checklist Does your hypothesis focus on something that you can actually test?

Does your hypothesis include both an independent and dependent variable?

Can you manipulate the variables?

Can your hypothesis be tested without violating ethical standards?

Types of Hypotheses

The hypothesis you use will depend on what you are investigating and hoping to find. Some of the main types of hypotheses that you might use include:

Simple hypothesis : This type of hypothesis suggests that there is a relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable.

: This type of hypothesis suggests that there is a relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable. Complex hypothesis : This type of hypothesis suggests a relationship between three or more variables, such as two independent variables and a dependent variable.

: This type of hypothesis suggests a relationship between three or more variables, such as two independent variables and a dependent variable. Null hypothesis : This hypothesis suggests no relationship exists between two or more variables.

: This hypothesis suggests no relationship exists between two or more variables. Alternative hypothesis : This hypothesis states the opposite of the null hypothesis.

: This hypothesis states the opposite of the null hypothesis. Statistical hypothesis : This hypothesis uses statistical analysis to evaluate a representative sample of the population and then generalizes the findings to the larger group.

: This hypothesis uses statistical analysis to evaluate a representative sample of the population and then generalizes the findings to the larger group. Logical hypothesis: This hypothesis assumes a relationship between variables without collecting data or evidence.



Hypotheses Examples

A hypothesis often follows a basic format of "If {this happens} then {this will happen}." One way to structure your hypothesis is to describe what will happen to the dependent variable if you change the independent variable.

The basic format might be: "If {these changes are made to a certain independent variable}, then we will observe {a change in a specific dependent variable}."

A few examples of simple hypotheses:

"Students who eat breakfast will perform better on a math exam than students who do not eat breakfast."

Complex hypothesis: "Students who experience test anxiety before an English exam will get lower scores than students who do not experience test anxiety."​

"Motorists who talk on the phone while driving will be more likely to make errors on a driving course than those who do not talk on the phone."

Examples of a complex hypothesis include:

"People with high-sugar diets and sedentary activity levels are more likely to develop depression."

"Younger people who are regularly exposed to green, outdoor areas have better subjective well-being than older adults who have limited exposure to green spaces."

Examples of a null hypothesis include:

"Children who receive a new reading intervention will have scores different than students who do not receive the intervention."

"There will be no difference in scores on a memory recall task between children and adults."

Examples of an alternative hypothesis:

"Children who receive a new reading intervention will perform better than students who did not receive the intervention."

"Adults will perform better on a memory task than children."

Collecting Data on Your Hypothesis

Once a researcher has formed a testable hypothesis, the next step is to select a research design and start collecting data. The research method depends largely on exactly what they are studying. There are two basic types of research methods: descriptive research and experimental research.

Descriptive Research Methods

Descriptive research such as case studies, naturalistic observations, and surveys are often used when it would be impossible or difficult to conduct an experiment. These methods are best used to describe different aspects of a behavior or psychological phenomenon.

Once a researcher has collected data using descriptive methods, a correlational study can then be used to look at how the variables are related. This type of research method might be used to investigate a hypothesis that is difficult to test experimentally.

Experimental Research Methods

Experimental methods are used to demonstrate causal relationships between variables. In an experiment, the researcher systematically manipulates a variable of interest (known as the independent variable) and measures the effect on another variable (known as the dependent variable).

Unlike correlational studies, which can only be used to determine if there is a relationship between two variables, experimental methods can be used to determine the actual nature of the relationship—whether changes in one variable actually cause another to change.

A Word From Verywell

The hypothesis is a critical part of any scientific exploration. It represents what researchers expect to find in a study or experiment. In situations where the hypothesis is unsupported by the research, the research still has value. Such research helps us better understand how different aspects of the natural world relate to one another. It also helps us develop new hypotheses that can then be tested in the future.
Neuropsychological evaluation is no longer limited to earlier considerations of “brain damage” or of regional diagnosis. Present-day emphasis, instead, is on an understanding of the ways in which psychological functions are compromised or spared by neurological disorders. One goal of such an evaluation is to provide a basis for developing strategies of compensation or retraining, which will allow the individual with acquired deficits to function more effectively. Thus, there is a need for flexibility to cover all types of cases likely to be presented. Hypothesis-testing methodology is seen as an efficient way to pursue this aim. Centered on the examination of single cases, it regards clinical neuropsychology as an applied science. As such, it calls on all relevant knowledge from neuropsychology and related disciplines, such as neurology and neuropathology, as well as cognate areas of psychology.

Answer: In the field of brain psychology, a hypothesis is considered to give a good result if it is based on thorough research, is testable, includes independent and dependent variables, and can be tested without violating ethical standards. The hypothesis should be formed after collecting observations, evaluating possible causes, and creating a list of explanations to explore. It should also be falsifiable, meaning it can be proven false if it is indeed false. Additionally, operational definitions of variables are important to ensure that the results are replicable and understandable by other researchers.

Answer: In the field of neuropsychology, a good hypothesis is determined by its ability to effectively guide the understanding of how psychological functions are affected by neurological disorders. A hypothesis is considered good if it is based on relevant knowledge from neuropsychology and related disciplines, such as neurology and neuropathology, and if it can be tested through hypothesis-testing methodology. This approach involves examining single cases and using the hypothesis to develop strategies for compensation or retraining, allowing individuals with acquired deficits to function more effectively. The hypothesis should be flexible enough to cover various types of cases and should be grounded in scientific principles that allow for testing and potential falsification.

Answer: 1. **Model Accuracy**: The simulation environment may have highly accurate vehicle dynamics and sensor models that do not fully capture the complexities and variabilities of real-world conditions. This could lead to the algorithm performing better in simulations where conditions are more predictable and controlled.

2. **Scenario Accumulation**: The scenarios used in the simulation might not fully represent the diversity and unpredictability of real-world driving situations. Real-world data might include unexpected events or behaviors that are not present in the simulated scenarios.

3. **Traffic Modeling**: The behavior of other road users in the simulation might be based on idealized or simplified models that do not accurately reflect the erratic or unpredictable behavior of real drivers, leading to better performance in simulations.

4. **Sensor Limitations**: In real-life scenarios, sensors might face issues such as noise, interference, or environmental factors (e.g., weather conditions) that are not present in the simulation, affecting the algorithm's performance.

5. **Data Quality**: The quality and resolution of data used in simulations might be higher than what is available in real-world scenarios, leading to more precise and reliable inputs for the algorithm in the simulated environment.

6. **Controlled Environment**: Simulations provide a controlled environment where variables can be precisely managed, whereas real-world conditions are subject to a wide range of uncontrollable factors that can impact the algorithm's effectiveness.

Context: To meet the needs of the widest range of students, what should teachers consider when planning their instruction?

Page 5: Instructional Materials

Now that the team at Sycamore Middle School knows how to develop UDL goals, they are ready to learn how instructional materials can incorporate UDL principles. Like most teachers across the nation, the Sycamore teachers use printed text as their primary medium for teaching. In addition, when teaching the unit on ancient Egypt, the sixth-grade teachers at Sycamore typically lecture, show videos, and distribute informational handouts and worksheets.

As the Sycamore team evaluates the use of these materials, they learn that these traditional media types—text, audio, and images or graphics—are fixed. In other words, the media cannot be altered to meet the needs of all students. Consequently, many students do not find the materials engaging, whereas others may not find them challenging. The table below outlines potential barriers for each media type.

UDL Materials

As was mentioned above, traditional materials or media are fixed—that is, the content is fused to the material and cannot be separated from it. For example, the text in a book cannot be manipulated; it is static. The UDL approach encourages teachers to use materials that are more flexible and that therefore enable them to present concepts in a variety of ways to better meet the needs of a diverse group of learners. The most common type of flexible media is digital text, a format in which the content is separate from the manner in which it is presented. For example, the digital text on a computer screen can be manipulated in many different ways (e.g., by increasing the font size, switching on the text to speech feature, highlighting text as it is read) to make it more accessible to more students.

In addition to encouraging them to use flexible materials, UDL encourages teachers to use alternate materials or media (e.g., scaled models, tactile materials). Teachers can also maximize students’ access by using appropriate scaffolds and supports (e.g., graphic organizers, spellcheckers). By using a combination of flexible materials and media and allowing students to choose the materials they work with, teachers can incorporate the UDL principles—representation, action and expression, and engagement.

x scaled model Any model, either larger or smaller than the original object, the parts of which are in equal proportion to their actual size.

Transcript: David Rose Universal Design for Learning is a lot like the exercise machines at a good gym. The point of having very flexible materials is to be able to make the challenge appropriate and also the supports. An exercise gym does both of those: It allows you to customize the seat, the supports, so that you can begin your exercise. The key thing is it must be adjustable, must provide the support that’s right for you getting the seat too high, too low, having the back too far. All of those things create not a good exercise environment. So in UDL, what we talk about is making sure the supports are available that are appropriate. Exercise is no good if there isn’t actually a challenge. There does need to be a weight that you’re pulling against in the gym, and in UDL, similarly, we need to make sure there is a challenge. Students need to be learning things, can’t be wasting their time, but the weight that is perfect for one person is a weight that is too heavy or too light for someone else. What UDL does is say we need to build curricular and environments for learning that have enough flexibility to say the challenge can be varied. We’re all going to do this same lesson but you’re going do it in this way that is quite challenging, and another student will do it in a slightly different way that is the right challenge for them. Similarly, we’re going to say we’re going to get you supported before you begin this lesson so you’re prepared to be at your best. We challenge both lowest and highest performing. We set challenges for everybody and supports wherever they’re needed.

UDL materials may be created by publishers, educational technology producers, state departments of education, school districts, or teachers, among others. Wherever it comes from, by presenting the content in a variety of ways, teachers can maximize the probability that all students, regardless of their learning needs and preferences, will be able to access it.

Keep in Mind Though students might use different media to explore and learn the same concepts and skills, the learning goal should be the same for all students even as it challenges them individually.

When identifying materials to use during the presentation of a lesson, the teacher should consider the content or skill to be taught. For example, students who are learning about chemical reactions might benefit more from a hands-on experience than from reading text.

After learning how UDL principles apply to materials, the team at Sycamore Middle School generates more options for students to access the content on ancient Egypt. They will continue to use some of their traditional materials but will apply the three UDL principles to make the materials more accessible and engaging to a greater number of students. They also decide to include additional materials to address their students’ diverse needs and learning preferences. Their ideas are summarized in the table below.

Accompany lectures with slides to provide students with the option of accessing the information visually; slides can serve as a scaffold for students who have difficulty identifying key points, taking notes, and processing aural information. Provide students with the option of using graphic organizers for note taking.

Additional Materials Websites Offer students the option of accessing the information through digital text. Because digital text is flexible (rather than fixed like printed text), it can be either manipulated for easier visual access or converted to speech. Allow students of different ability levels to work on content that is challenging for them. Embedded information allows students to access additional or background information.

Three-dimensional models of pyramids and mummies Provide students with the option of accessing information in a hands-on format to aid tactile and kinesthetic learners as well as students with visual impairments.


Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework to improve and optimize teaching and learning for all people based on scientific insights into how humans learn.

Find out how the UDL framework guides the design of instructional goals, assessments, methods, and materials that can be customized and adjusted to meet individual needs.

CAST created the Universal Design for Learning framework, and it remains one of our core levers of change to help make learning inclusive and transformative for everyone.

Answer: To cater to students of different abilities in a class, teachers should consider using the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework. This involves:

1. **Flexible Materials**: Use digital text and other flexible media that can be manipulated to meet diverse learning needs. For example, digital text can be adjusted for font size, color, or converted to speech.

2. **Multiple Means of Representation**: Present information in various formats, such as text, audio, and visual aids, to accommodate different learning preferences and needs.

3. **Multiple Means of Action and Expression**: Allow students to demonstrate their understanding in different ways, such as through written work, oral presentations, or hands-on projects.

4. **Multiple Means of Engagement**: Provide choices in learning activities to increase student engagement and motivation. This could include using interactive websites, three-dimensional models, or tactile materials.

5. **Scaffolds and Supports**: Use tools like graphic organizers, spellcheckers, and slides to support students in processing information and taking notes.

6. **Challenging and Supportive Environment**: Ensure that learning challenges are appropriate for each student, providing the right level of difficulty and support to maximize learning.

By incorporating these strategies, teachers can create an inclusive learning environment that addresses the diverse needs of all students.

task. If performed effectively, this allows a group of samples to be stained and run under the exact same conditions, eliminating batch effects. Differences in sample collection and storage may still be visible, but barcoding will go a long way towards reducing the effects of differential sample prep and acquisition.

When undertaking a longitudinal study using spectral cytometry, some consideration should be given to what kind of reference controls will be used (whether beads or cells) - either collecting a new set of controls for each batch or sample, or collecting a 'gold-standard' set at the beginning. Choosing correctly can also aid in preventing batch effects. Using one set of initial reference controls might be indicated if the reagents are known to be stable, the samples in the study are well characterized and persistent, and there is an increased risk of technical preparation errors expected during the study. Per batch sets of reference controls may be indicated if the batch

then they count in the total of 20 samples or extracts for this batch.

Analysis batch - A group of up to 20 samples, sample extracts, or sample digestates (including QC aliquots), that are analyzed together on the same instrument. For the analysis of volatiles, there may be no sample preparation equipment other than that attached directly to the determinative instrument (e.g., Methods 5030B and 8260B), so the analysis batch drives the frequency of the method blank and LCS for volatiles, as well as the frequency of calibration verification standards for methods using external standard calibration. The limit of 20 in the analysis batch includes all the analyses, including the method blank, LCS, MS, and MSD, so that an analysis batch for volatiles will include fewer than 20 field samples. However, as noted above, the MS/MSD may be analyzed on another shift or other equivalent instrument.

For extractable organics and metals, the analysis batch will drive the frequency of the calibration
Answer: Processing samples and their positive and negative reagent controls in locked batches ensures that all samples are stained and run under the exact same conditions, which helps eliminate batch effects. This approach reduces variability due to differential sample preparation and acquisition, providing consistency across the samples. It also allows for a more controlled environment where technical preparation errors can be minimized, especially if the reagents are stable and the samples are well-characterized.

On the other hand, allowing for prioritization based on sample priority and received date might introduce variability due to differences in processing conditions, which could lead to batch effects. However, it could be beneficial in situations where certain samples need to be processed urgently.

Separation of samples into different batches based on priority or received date could provide more points of comparison for investigations, as it allows for the analysis of how different processing times and conditions affect the results. However, this could also complicate the analysis due to the introduction of additional variables.

Overall, processing in locked batches is beneficial for consistency and reducing batch effects, while separation based on priority might be useful for urgent samples but could introduce variability.

Answer: Processing samples and their positive and negative reagent controls in locked batches offers several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Locked batches ensure that all samples are processed under the same conditions, which helps eliminate batch effects. This consistency is crucial for obtaining reliable and comparable results across all samples.

2. **Reduced Variability**: By processing samples together, the variability introduced by different processing times, conditions, or reagent lots is minimized. This leads to more accurate and reproducible data.

3. **Simplified Quality Control**: With locked batches, quality control measures such as method blanks and calibration standards are applied uniformly, making it easier to identify and correct any issues that arise during the analysis.

4. **Efficient Use of Resources**: Processing in batches can be more resource-efficient, as it allows for the simultaneous handling of multiple samples, reducing the time and cost associated with individual processing.

On the other hand, allowing for prioritization based on sample priority and received date can be beneficial in certain scenarios:

1. **Flexibility**: This approach provides the flexibility to process urgent or high-priority samples more quickly, which can be critical in time-sensitive studies or clinical settings.

2. **Timeliness**: Samples can be processed as they are received, potentially leading to faster turnaround times for results.

However, this flexibility can introduce more variability and make it challenging to compare results across different processing times and conditions. Separation of samples for processing based on priority or received date may provide more points of comparison for investigations, but it also increases the risk of batch effects and inconsistencies in the data. Therefore, the choice between locked batches and prioritized processing should be made based on the specific needs and goals of the study, balancing the need for consistency with the need for flexibility.

This is a diagram of the crystal structure of deuterated pyridine. (c) Wiley-VCH 2008

(PhysOrg.com) -- The nuclei of ordinary hydrogen atoms contain only a single proton. If a neutron is added, the hydrogen becomes deuterium. In principle, molecules that contain deuterium in place of hydrogen atoms are chemically identical. However, there can be significant differences. Thus “heavy water”, water with molecules that contain deuterium in place of hydrogen, is toxic because it disrupts highly sensitive biochemical processes in the body and leads to metabolic failure.

As researchers report in the journal Angewandte Chemie, when the hydrogen atoms of pyridine are replaced with deuterium, it adopts a crystalline form that can only be achieved under high pressure with “normal” pyridine. Perhaps the minimal differences responsible for this type of effect can be implemented to improve the spectrum of properties available to pharmaceutical agents.

Answer: To synthesize a fully deuterated version of pyridine, you would need to replace all the hydrogen atoms in pyridine with deuterium. Based on the context provided, one approach to achieve this could involve using deuterium oxide (D2O) in the presence of a catalyst. 

For example, you could dissolve pyridine in a suitable solvent and then expose it to D2O under specific conditions, such as elevated temperatures and possibly under vacuum or an inert atmosphere, to facilitate the exchange of hydrogen atoms with deuterium. The use of a catalyst, such as an iridium-based catalyst, might be necessary to enhance the deuteration process. 

The process might require optimization of conditions like temperature, pressure, and reaction time to achieve full deuteration. Additionally, monitoring the reaction progress using techniques like NMR spectroscopy could help ensure that all hydrogen atoms are replaced with deuterium.

Answer: To synthesize a fully deuterated version of pyridine, you would need to replace all the hydrogen atoms in pyridine with deuterium. According to the context provided, deuterated pyridine can adopt a crystalline form that is typically only achievable under high pressure with normal pyridine. While the specific synthesis method is not detailed in the context, a general approach would involve using deuterium gas (D2) or deuterated solvents in the presence of a catalyst to facilitate the exchange of hydrogen atoms with deuterium. You might also consider using a deuterated reagent, such as D2O, in a reaction that allows for the exchange of hydrogen atoms in pyridine with deuterium. It is important to control the reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, to optimize the deuteration process. Consulting specific scientific literature or experimental protocols on deuteration reactions would provide more detailed guidance tailored to pyridine.

Answer: Cartesian dualism is a philosophical concept developed by René Descartes, which posits that the immaterial mind and the material body are two distinct types of substances that interact with each other. Descartes famously summarized this idea with the phrase "cogito ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"), emphasizing the separation between the mind (a thinking, non-extended entity) and the body (an extended, non-thinking entity). This dualism raises the "problem of interactionism," questioning how an immaterial mind can cause events in a material body and vice versa.

GraphRAG Score: 13Question: What are targets for SEN pupils?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Good target-setting is central to effective teaching and learning for pupils with special education needs. There are four guiding principles when devising targets for pupils. Targets should be:

Linked to assessment

Strengths-based

Linked to interventions

Developed collaboratively

Best practice indicates that targets should be few in number; they should be informed by priority learning needs and directly linked to suitable interventions. Targets should be based on the evidence collected through both formal and informal assessment approaches. Schools should consult with parents when setting targets and reviewing progress. The views of pupils should also be included in this process, through their direct involvement in the discussion or by gathering their views in advance of the review process. This collaboration will help ensure that targets are relevant, meaningful, realistic, and that they draw on the strengths and interests of pupils.

Targets should be expressed in a way that is measurable and observable, and should reflect the specific special educational needs of individual pupils (for example, focus on social and emotional difficulties if that is a primary area of concern). While targets should be achievable within a specified time frame, they should also challenge and build on existing knowledge and address pupils’ holistic needs.

Answer: Targets for SEN (Special Education Needs) pupils are specific goals set to guide their learning and development. These targets are informed by priority learning needs and are directly linked to suitable interventions. They are based on evidence collected through both formal and informal assessments and are developed collaboratively with input from parents and the pupils themselves. The targets are strengths-based, measurable, observable, and reflect the specific special educational needs of individual pupils. They are designed to be achievable within a specified time frame while also challenging the pupils and addressing their holistic needs.

In addition, when teaching the unit on ancient Egypt, the sixth-grade teachers at Sycamore typically lecture, show videos, and distribute informational handouts and worksheets.\\n\\nAs the Sycamore team evaluates the use of these materials, they learn that these traditional media types—text, audio, and images or graphics—are fixed. In other words, the media cannot be altered to meet the needs of all students. Consequently, many students do not find the materials engaging, whereas others may not find them challenging.

For example, the text in a book cannot be manipulated; it is static. The UDL approach encourages teachers to use materials that are more flexible and that therefore enable them to present concepts in a variety of ways to better meet the needs of a diverse group of learners. The most common type of flexible media is digital text, a format in which the content is separate from the manner in which it is presented. For example, the digital text on a computer screen can be manipulated in many different ways (e.g., by increasing the font size, switching on the text to speech feature, highlighting text as it is read) to make it more accessible to more students.\\n\\nClick here to learn more about the benefits of digital text.

The point of having very flexible materials is to be able to make the challenge appropriate and also the supports. An exercise gym does both of those: It allows you to customize the seat, the supports, so that you can begin your exercise. The key thing is it must be adjustable, must provide the support that’s right for you getting the seat too high, too low, having the back too far. All of those things create not a good exercise environment. So in UDL, what we talk about is making sure the supports are available that are appropriate. Exercise is no good if there isn’t actually a challenge. There does need to be a weight that you’re pulling against in the gym, and in UDL, similarly, we need to make sure there is a challenge. Students need to be learning things, can’t be wasting their time, but the weight that is perfect for one person is a weight that is too heavy or too light for someone else. What UDL does is say we need to build curricular and environments for learning that have enough flexibility to say the challenge can be varied. We’re all going to do this same lesson but you’re going do it in this way that is quite challenging, and another student will do it in a slightly different way that is the right challenge for them. Similarly, we’re going to say we’re going to get you supported before you begin this lesson so you’re prepared to be at your best. We challenge both lowest and highest performing. We set challenges for everybody and supports wherever they’re needed.\\n\\nUDL materials may be created by publishers, educational technology producers, state departments of education, school districts, or teachers, among others. Wherever it comes from, by presenting the content in a variety of ways, teachers can maximize the probability that all students, regardless of their learning needs and preferences, will be able to access it.\\n\\nKeep in Mind Though students might use different media to explore and learn the same concepts and skills, the learning goal should be the same for all students even as it challenges them individually.\\n\\nWhen identifying materials to use during the presentation of a lesson, the teacher should consider the content or skill to be taught. For example, students who are learning about chemical reactions might benefit more from a hands-on experience than from reading text.\\n\\nAfter learning how UDL principles apply to materials, the team at Sycamore Middle School generates more options for students to access the content on ancient Egypt. They will continue to use some of their traditional materials but will apply the three UDL principles to make the materials more accessible and engaging to a greater number of students.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: People with bipolar disorder experience periods of unusually intense emotion and changes in sleep patterns and activity levels, and engage in behaviors that are out of character for them—often without recognizing their likely harmful or undesirable effects. These distinct periods are called mood episodes. Mood episodes are very different from the person’s usual moods and behaviors. During an episode, the symptoms last every day for most of the day. Episodes may also last for longer periods, such as several days or weeks.

Symptoms of a Manic Episode Symptoms of a Depressive Episode Feeling very up, high, elated, or extremely irritable or touchy Feeling very down or sad, or anxious Feeling jumpy or wired, more active than usual Feeling slowed down or restless Having a decreased need for sleep Having trouble falling asleep, waking up too early, or sleeping too much Talking fast about a lot of different things (“flight of ideas”) Talking very slowly, feeling unable to find anything to say, or forgetting a lot Racing thoughts Having trouble concentrating or making decisions Feeling able to do many things at once without getting tired Feeling unable to do even simple things Having excessive appetite for food, drinking, sex, or other pleasurable activities Having a lack of interest in almost all activities Feeling unusually important, talented, or powerful Feeling hopeless or worthless, or thinking about death or suicide

Sometimes people have both manic and depressive symptoms in the same episode, and this is called an episode with mixed features. During an episode with mixed features, people may feel very sad, empty, or hopeless while at the same time feeling extremely energized.

A person may have bipolar disorder even if their symptoms are less extreme. For example, some people with bipolar II disorder experience hypomania, a less severe form of mania. During a hypomanic episode, a person may feel very good, be able to get things done, and keep up with day-to-day life. The person may not feel that anything is wrong, but family and friends may recognize changes in mood or activity levels as possible symptoms of bipolar disorder. Without proper treatment, people with hypomania can develop severe mania or depression.

Diagnosis

Receiving the right diagnosis and treatment can help people with bipolar disorder lead healthy and active lives. Talking with a health care provider is the first step. The health care provider can complete a physical exam and other necessary medical tests to rule out other possible causes. The health care provider may then conduct a mental health evaluation or provide a referral to a trained mental health care provider, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker who has experience in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder.

Mental health care providers usually diagnose bipolar disorder based on a person’s symptoms, lifetime history, experiences, and, in some cases, family history. Accurate diagnosis in youth is particularly important.

Find tips to help prepare for and get the most out of your visit with your health care provider.

Bipolar disorder and other conditions

Many people with bipolar disorder also have other mental disorders or conditions such as anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), misuse of drugs or alcohol, or eating disorders. Sometimes people who have severe manic or depressive episodes also have symptoms of psychosis, which may include hallucinations or delusions. The psychotic symptoms tend to match the person’s extreme mood. For example, someone having psychotic symptoms during a depressive episode may falsely believe they are financially ruined, while someone having psychotic symptoms during a manic episode may falsely believe they are famous or have special powers.

Looking at a person’s symptoms over the course of the illness and examining their family history can help a health care provider determine whether the person has bipolar disorder along with another disorder.
Overview

Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).

When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.

Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.

Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy).

Symptoms

There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life.

Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).

You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.

You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).

You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.

Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment.

Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time.

Mania and hypomania

Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization.

Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms:

Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired

Increased activity, energy or agitation

Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)

Decreased need for sleep

Unusual talkativeness

Racing thoughts

Distractibility

Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments

Major depressive episode

A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms:

Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability)

Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all — or almost all — activities

Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression)

Either insomnia or sleeping too much

Either restlessness or slowed behavior

Fatigue or loss of energy

Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt

Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness

Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide

Other features of bipolar disorder

Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons.

Symptoms in children and teens

Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder.

Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes.

The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings.

When to see a doctor

Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need.

And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out — and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble.

If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control.

When to get emergency help

Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat. Services are free and confidential.

If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.

Causes

The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as:

Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes.

People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder.

Risk factors

Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include:

Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder

Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event

Drug or alcohol abuse

Complications

Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as:

Problems related to drug and alcohol use

Suicide or suicide attempts

Legal or financial problems

Damaged relationships

Poor work or school performance

Co-occurring conditions

If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include:

Anxiety disorders

Eating disorders

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

Alcohol or drug problems

Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity

Prevention

There's no sure way to prevent bipolar disorder. However, getting treatment at the earliest sign of a mental health disorder can help prevent bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions from worsening.

If you've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, some strategies can help prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes of mania or depression:
Answer: Based on the symptoms described, the possible diagnoses could include:

1. **Bipolar I Disorder**: This diagnosis is possible if the patient has experienced at least one manic episode, which may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. The symptoms of heightened mood, impulsivity, and reduced inhibitions suggest the presence of manic or hypomanic episodes.

2. **Bipolar II Disorder**: This diagnosis is possible if the patient has experienced at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but never a full manic episode. The low mood, insomnia, and anhedonia suggest a depressive episode, while the periods of heightened mood and impulsivity suggest hypomanic episodes.

3. **Cyclothymic Disorder**: This diagnosis could be considered if the patient has had at least two years (or one year in children and teenagers) of many periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms, though less severe than major depression.

The presence of both depressive and manic/hypomanic symptoms suggests a bipolar spectrum disorder. A thorough assessment by a mental health professional would be necessary to determine the specific diagnosis.

Answer: Based on the symptoms described, the possible diagnoses could include:

1. **Bipolar I Disorder**: This involves episodes of mania and major depression. The patient's symptoms of low mood, insomnia, and anhedonia could indicate a depressive episode, while the periods of heightened mood, impulsivity, and reduced inhibitions suggest a manic episode.

2. **Bipolar II Disorder**: This involves episodes of major depression and hypomania (a less severe form of mania). The patient's symptoms could fit this diagnosis if the heightened mood episodes are less severe than full mania.

3. **Cyclothymic Disorder**: This involves periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms that are less severe than major depression. If the patient's symptoms are less extreme, this could be a possibility.

4. **Bipolar Disorder with Mixed Features**: This occurs when symptoms of both mania and depression are present simultaneously. The patient's symptoms could suggest this if they experience both depressive and manic symptoms at the same time.

A thorough assessment by a mental health professional is necessary to determine the exact diagnosis.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: The extraction and processing of gold is as expensive and laborious as it is profitable. You must purchase tools, manpower and infrastructure, and then take on the challenging work of extraction — likely by hard rock mining or the dredging of rivers or lakes. Finally you will separate the gold from other rocks and minerals, often with sodium cyanide, and refine it by smelting the gold ore or by using electric current or acids.

Determine your gold extraction method. Viable methods include hard rock mining (the most costly and productive method), dredging rivers and lakes (used by small business) and byproduct mining, in which gold is extracted as a byproduct when mining for other metals.

Purchase tools, manpower and infrastructure required for extraction. For instance, hard rock mining can require drilling to depths of up to 3900 meters. Extract the gold ore and transport it to your gold processing unit.

Separate the gold from unwanted rocks and minerals using one of several methods. You can mix the gold ore with sodium cyanide, which will attach itself to the gold and separate other elements such as zinc. Or pan the gold manually in water to separate gold from the gravel and sand in a stream.

Refine the gold you have extracted and separated. Use Miller and Wohlwill processes, which process gold chloride by subjecting it to an electric current; this separates gold from impurities and attaches it to the anodes generating the current. Alternatively, use acids and dissolution in ores that are affected by acid-soluble feedstocks, or smelt gold ore and remove the dross that accumulates on the top of the mixture.

You learn real fast why gold is worth so much, because it’s hard to find and hard work to recover. You’ve got to examine a lot of sand before you’re successful. “

How and Where to Find Gold in The Desert – “Gold is not going to go too far from its source unless there’s been lots of time and lots of water to wash it downhill,” says David Steimle, a chapter president of the Gold Prospectors Association of America (GPAA). Standing recently in a wadi at the foot of Arizona’s Santa Rita Mountains, he said, “Flood waters thousands of years ago washed nuggets down the mountain through these arroyos and deposited the gold flakes we’re looking for today. Prospectors who have worked these gullies know they don’t produce a lot of sizable chunks, but they do give up a bunch of fine gold dust.

An Overview of Basic Gold Separation Methods

A Shaker Table is another method commonly used at larger mining operations. When set up properly they are extremely efficient at recovering the smallest gold particles. In many mining operations, shaker tables are the preferred method of free-milling gold separation from black sands or crushed ores.

Concentration Methods – Artisanal mining refers to the use of simple rudimentary tools and processes to extract minerals resources such as gold from the soils on a small scale. In most developing the mining industry is not well developed. This means that large scale sophisticated mining operations are not very common. Most of the mining in such conditions involve small scale miners who don’t have enough resources to by sophisticated machines to help in the mining process.

It theory a minimum of all we wanted to complete was grind the cinnabar to some fine powder, as well as heat it lightly, whereupon the mercury sulfide readily decomposes, producing mercury vapour (and sulfur). The mercury vapour could be condensed around the walls of the cold test tube as metallic beads, which makes them really simple to gather.

We also need a special kind of hammer, which fits into the container without leaving too much room for the rock to escape. Rather than use a conventional hammer, we used pulleys and a rope to raise and drop a heavy weight. Pulleys increase the length of rope that needs to be pulled in order to raise the heavy weight but at the same time they reduce resistance. If we use a two-pulley system we will have to pull the rope twice as far as if we had one pulley or no pulleys at all, but we will be able to lift twice as much weight. This would be useful because, for the same effort, we can use twice the weight to crush our rocks.

History: California Gold Rush – Kids learn about the California Gold Rush from the Old West. Thousands of people move to the west to search for gold and strike it rich.

A lot of boomtowns eventually turned into abandoned ghost towns. When the gold ran out in an area, the miners would leave to find the next gold strike. The businesses would leave too and soon the town would be empty and abandoned. One example of a gold rush ghost town is Bodie, California. Today it is a popular tourist attraction.

Crush and Melt! How to Remove Gold from Rich Ores

You will need to remove the mineral from the rock and pan it out to determine if it’s gold or not. If it is gold then crushing and extreme heat are needed.

There will always be a couple of common-sense reminders when heating anything, for example not attempting to melt gold near anything flammable. That could seem like something stupid, however, many prospectors have become so excited by the idea of seeing their gold, apparently apparent safeguards were forgotten.

Removing the Gold from the Rock

Thankfully, generations of prospectors have figured out how to solve this little problem. You cannot just heat rocks and expect the gold to drip out. First, the gold must be removed from its surrounding material. Today, the big corporations which mine most of the gold have complicated processes and equipment which are far beyond what a small prospector is capable of. Fortunately, methods developed all the way back in the 1840s still work just fine for a casual gold hunter.

Things You’ll Need

Tips

Warnings

One of the easiest and most inexpensive ways to separate gold from dirt is through panning. This age-old technique has been around since the Gold Rush, and makes a great outdoor hobby that can pay for itself. With a minimum of equipment, the beginner gold prospector can separate gold flakes and nuggets from the surrounding strata in a nearby stream. The supply of gold is virtually endless, as erosion constantly causes hidden gold to be brought to the surface where it is free for the taking. All you have to do is find it. Select an appropriate stream. Either choose a stream on publicly owned land, or ask the private owner’s permission before doing any panning. Quickly moving streams are best, because the clear water prevents sediment from obstructing your view of the gold. The stream should be at least 6 inches deep so you can keep your pan submerged for the majority of the process. Find a promising spot within the stream itself. Sandbars or plant growth on the inside bends are possible places for gold to have washed up with other sediments.

How to Separate Gold From Sand?

The mining and extraction of gold from sand are usually carried out at the same time. The process of separating gold from sand mainly consists of four steps: strongcrushing and screening, remove slime from gold sand, separation, thickening and dewatering stage./strong.

Video advice: How to separate Gold from black sand easily and get all the gold out

How to process black sand concentrates is a big deal and it frustrates many new prospectors and old ones as well. The goal is to get a clean gold placer that can be sold or melted down into a bar. Historic methods were toxic, but there are better alternatives now. Carefully selected magnets, used a little at a time, wiith weak magnets first and then stronger can do a great job of cleaning up your gold concentrates.

Gold sand concentrates and tailings that have been separated usually contain a large amount of water, especially tailings. Many countries stipulate that the water cannot be discharged if it does not meet the standards. Using the tailings dry stacking system can greatly reduce the water content of the gold concentrate and tailings. And the water discharged can also be recycled.

Thickening and Dewatering

Screening process can remove 20%-40% of waste rock (gravel, pebbles), which is an essential part of gold ore dressing. Screen parameters required for screening operations often require reference to the particle size of the gold. At present, the screen holes selected by many gold mines are generally 10-20mm. If the chute is used for coarse sorting equipment, the screen hole can be larger, but generally does not exceed 60 mm. The equipment used in different types of gold extraction plants is different, the screening equipment used in fixed gold extraction plants is mostly vibrating screen, while the trommel is used in gold mining ships. Generally, water should be added in the screening operation, and its flushing capacity should be determined according to the requirements of ore washing, and should be meet the requirements of concentration in the next stage of separation operation as far as possible. For example, when using a chute for rough processing, the amount of flushing should be 8-14 times that of sand.

Fine Gold Recovery. Separating Placer Gold Particles from Black Sands

Separating fine gold particles from black sands is one of the biggest challenges that gold prospectors have to deal with. This article will describe a simple and inexpensive method of capturing fine gold. Most small scale prospectors do not need to invest thousands of dollars to capture small placer gold dust. Using fine gold recovery methods, you can retain the vast majority of gold in your black sand concentrates.

Recovering fine gold from black sands is among the most difficult facets of gold mining. When we’re all wishing to locate that when-in-a-lifetime gold nugget, most gold that people find as prospectors is extremely small in dimensions, varying from gold flakes lower to dust so small that it’s nearly invisible. Very fine particles of gold like this is very hard to outside of black sands along with other minerals which have virtually no value. Despite their small size, the buildup of the fine gold can equal to substantial amounts, so it’s within the prospector’s welfare to locate a process that can help assisted in the recovery of the fine gold to maximise their profits. The procedure needed to split up gold using their company minerals is straightforward enough to know. Gold, to be the heaviest element we typically encounter inside a stream, could be separated from lighter materials by various gravity separation methods. Gold panning is easily the most common method utilized by small-scale prospectors, but bigger mining equipment like gold dredges, sluice boxes, drywashers, and lots of other kinds of equipment uses gravity separation to release lighter material while retaining gold.

J Health Pollut. 2018 Sep; 8(19): 180909. AbstractBackground. The majority of small-scale gold miners worldwide, including those in Mozambique, use mercury to extract gold. Over the last fifty years, gold production from small-scale mining has been accelerating and consequently the amount of mercury released to the environment has increased dramatically, causing major global health problems. In 2018, a team from the Danish non-governmental organization Diálogos introduced the mercury-free gold extraction method in the Cabo Delgado province in Mozambique in the villages of Waqueia and Nanlia. Objectives. The objective of this project was to teach local miners this method to reduce mercury pollution. An additional objective was to compare the local gold extraction method and the mercury-free gold extraction method in terms of gold recovery. The hypothesis was that the level of gold recovery would be higher with the mercury-free method compared to the locally used amalgamation method. Materials and Methods.

What methods are used to extract gold? The two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold.
Answer: To separate gold from other materials, you can use several methods:

1. Panning: This is a simple method where you use a pan to separate gold from soil or gravel. You fill the pan with the material and water, then swirl it around. The gold, being denser, will settle at the bottom, while lighter materials will wash away.

2. Using Sodium Cyanide: This chemical method involves mixing the gold ore with sodium cyanide, which attaches to the gold and separates it from other elements like zinc.

3. Manual Panning in Water: This involves using water to separate gold from gravel and sand in a stream. The gold, being heavier, will settle at the bottom of the pan.

4. Shaker Table: This method is used in larger mining operations. It involves using a table that vibrates to separate gold particles from other materials.

5. Refining: After separation, the gold can be refined using the Miller and Wohlwill processes, which involve processing gold chloride with an electric current to separate gold from impurities. Alternatively, acids and dissolution can be used for ores affected by acid-soluble feedstocks, or smelting can be used to remove dross from gold ore.

Answer: To separate gold, you typically use a process called gold panning or more advanced methods like sluicing, dredging, or using a gold concentrator. In gold panning, you use a pan to separate gold from other materials by swirling water in the pan, allowing the heavier gold to settle at the bottom. For more efficient separation, chemical processes like cyanidation or the use of mercury (in small-scale mining) can be employed, though these methods require careful handling due to environmental and health risks.

We all have life events that distract us from work from time to time — an ailing family member, a divorce, the death of a friend. You can’t expect someone to be at their best at such times. But as a manager what can you expect? How can you support the person to take care of themselves emotionally while also making sure they are doing their work (or as much of it as they are able to)?

What the Experts Say

Managing an employee who is going through a stressful period is “one of the real challenges all bosses face,” says Linda Hill, professor at Harvard Business School and author of Being the Boss. Most of us try to keep work and home separate, but “we all have situations in which our personal and professional lives collide,” and how you handle these situations with your employees is often a test of your leadership. You need to be empathetic and compassionate while also being professional and keeping your team productive. It’s a fine line to maintain, says Annie McKee, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education and author of How to Be Happy at Work. Here’s how to manage an employee going through a personal crisis.

Make yourself available

“People don’t always feel comfortable telling their boss” that a parent is gravely ill or that they feel stressed out in the wake of a crumbling relationship, says McKee. They may be too overwhelmed, or embarrassed that it is causing them to be late repeatedly or to miss deadlines. Often a manager’s first challenge is simply recognizing the warning signs that an employee is going through a difficult time. Invest time in building good relationships with employees so you’ll be able to detect any problems early on. If you maintain an atmosphere of compassion in the office, people are more likely to proactively come to you when they’re going through a tough period.

Don’t pry

As a leader, you need to be able to show empathy and care, but you also must avoid becoming an employee’s personal confidante. After all, your job as manager is not to be the office shrink. So don’t ask a bunch of questions about the employee’s problems. As the person with more power in the relationship, the employee may feel compelled to tell you more than they’re comfortable with. “You want to build a caring relationship with employees, not a friendly relationship,” says Hill. Many managers make the mistake of confusing being liked with being trusted or respected. A good manager “has the ability to read and understand other people’s needs and concerns,” says McKee, while still keeping everyone focused on the major task at hand: accomplishing work.

Listen first, suggest second

When you speak to an employee about their current struggles, “listen first instead of immediately advocating for some particular course of action,” says Hill. They may just want a sounding board about the difficulties of caring for a sick relative or an opportunity to explain why a divorce has affected their attention span. If you immediately suggest they take a leave of absence or adjust their schedule, they may be put off if that’s not what they were thinking. Instead, ask what both of you can do together to address the issue of performance during the difficult period. “Try to use the word ‘we,’” advises Hill, as in “How can we support you?” The employee may have an idea for a temporary arrangement — some time off, handing off a project to a colleague, or a more flexible schedule for a few weeks — that is amenable to you.

Know what you can offer

You may be more than willing to give a grieving employee several weeks of leave, or to offer a woman with a high-risk pregnancy the ability to work from home. But the decision isn’t always yours to make. “You may be very compassionate but you may be in a company where that’s not the way it works,” says Hill. Of course, if you have the leeway to get creative with a flexible schedule, an adjusted workload, or a temporary work-from-home arrangement, do what you think is best. But also be sure you understand your company’s restrictions on short- and long-term leave, and what, if any, bureaucratic hurdles exist before promising anything to your employee. Explain that you need to check what’s possible before you both commit to an arrangement.

If the employee needs counseling or drug or alcohol services, there may be resources provided by your company’s medical insurance that you can recommend. But investigate the quality of those resources first. “The last thing you want to do is send a suffering employee to avail themselves of a program or supposedly helpful people who then fall short,” says McKee.

Check in regularly to make sure they’re doing ok

Whether you’ve settled on a solution yet or not, check in with your employee occasionally by dropping by their desk (keeping their privacy in mind) or sending a brief email. Not only will your employee appreciate that you care, you’ll get a better sense of how they are coping. “You can simply ask, ‘Do you feel like you’ve got a handle on it?,’” says Hill. “And if they do, you can say, ‘Let’s just keep in touch so neither one of us has too many surprises. Or if you get a little over your head, I hope you’ll feel free to come to me and we can do some more problem solving and make further adjustments if necessary.’”

Consider workload

You also have to consider whether prolonged absences will adversely affect clients or team members. If so, mitigate those risks by easing the person’s workload. If there are people who are willing and able to take on some of the individual’s projects, you can do that temporarily. Just be sure to reward the people who are stepping in. And then set timelines for any adjustments you make. If the person knows that their situation will last for 6-8 weeks, set a deadline for you to meet and discuss what will happen next. Of course, many situations will be open-ended and in those cases, you can set interim deadlines when you get together to check in on how things are going and make adjustments as necessary. Whatever arrangements you make, be crystal clear about your expectations during this time period. Be realistic about what they can accomplish and set goals they can meet. “For this to be useful,” says McKee, “it’s got to be specific and it has be grounded in reality.”

Be transparent and consistent

Be conscious of the fact that other employees will take note of how you treat the struggling colleague and will likely expect similar consideration if they too run into difficult times in the future. “If you want to get productive work out of people, they need to trust you and believe that you’ll treat them fairly,” says Hill. Remember that policies may be precedent-setting. Every situation will be unique, but you want to be comfortable with policies in case you are called to apply them again. Keep in mind that solutions could apply to “the next person and the next and the next after that,” says McKee.

Principles to Remember

Do:

Set a tone of compassion in the office. It will not only give your employees confidence to approach you with struggles, but also give you the ability to spot warnings signs.

Be creative with solutions. A flexible schedule may allow a person to maintain their output without much disruption.

Check in from time to time, both to reassure the employee and to make sure that further adjustments or accommodations aren’t needed.

Don’t:

Act more like a therapist than a manager. Your heart may be in the right place, but don’t get involved in your employee’s personal problems.

Make promises you can’t keep. Research your company’s policies before you offer time off or alternative work arrangements.

Treat similar situations among employees differently. Employees will note — and resent — the inconsistency.

Case Study #1: Set realistic work goals with the employee and delegate some of their work

Alicia Shankland, a senior HR executive with more than 20 years of experience, managed two different women through the intensely stressful, emotional months of fertility treatment. In both cases, the treatments continued for nearly a year, so the women were away from work frequently for medical appointments and procedures. They also experienced severe ups and downs from the hormone drugs and the emotional devastation of miscarriages.

What’s more, the schedule of fertility treatments didn’t fit neatly into any of the existing standard HR leave policies. “There was no way to make a 30-60-90 day plan to accommodate all the unknowns,” Shankland said.

In each case, she endeavored to make as many allowances as possible, and the women used sick time, flex time, and personal days. She worked with each of them to set concrete, realistic work goals that allowed them to focus on the most critical deliverables while delegating other duties, and teammates pitched in to make sure duties weren’t neglected or dropped. “We managed through it as a tight-knit team,” she says.

A happy outcome was that the team was well prepared to cover for the maternity leaves that were eventually taken by each woman. “It actually showed us all that we could play multiple roles,” Shankland says. When the women returned from their respective maternity leaves, they were both at “110 percent.” Each had “exceptionally successful years at the company that more than made up for the time when they needed extra hands to make it through.”

Case Study #2: Act with compassion and offer flexibility if possible

When David*, a professional at a financial services firm, heard that the husband of one of his team members had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, he knew it was going to be a long and emotional roller coaster for her. Within weeks of the initial, grave diagnosis, doctors suggested that the cancer may not be spreading as fast as initially thought, and that the husband may have months to live, rather than mere weeks. That did little to lessen the emotional devastation. “It was so difficult to predict,” he said. It’s such an emotional time, and “you can’t ask for a timeframe. She wants to have a diagnosis and she wants to be able to maintain a regular work schedule. But she just doesn’t know.” From a manager’s standpoint, he said, “you have to take that burden off the employee.”

David recognized that it would be better to offer the woman more flexibility, a shift she happily embraced. The management team restructured her job away from her responsibilities in client services, which demanded high close rates and availability, to duties that weren’t as time sensitive. “This provided our team with less reliance on her and also gave her the freedom to focus on her important family matters that were the priority,” he said. She also agreed to switch her compensation from salaried to hourly, which allowed the firm the flexibility to carry on the arrangement indefinitely.

Ten months after the diagnosis, she was still with the company in the modified arrangement. “You have to act with compassion,” said David, “while also being responsible to clients and other employees.” Critical to the firm’s success? Making sure they could continue to be flexible. “Sometimes you just don’t know how a situation will end,” David said. “You need to keep an open mind.”

*Not his real name.
Answer: In this situation, it's important to approach the issue with empathy and professionalism. Here's how you can address it:

1. **Make Yourself Available**: Create an atmosphere of compassion and let the team member know that you are available to talk if they need support. This can encourage them to open up about their situation.

2. **Don't Pry**: Avoid asking intrusive questions about their personal life. Instead, focus on their work performance and express your willingness to support them.

3. **Listen First, Suggest Second**: Have a conversation with the team member to understand their current struggles. Listen to what they have to say and ask how you can support them during this difficult time. Use inclusive language like "How can we support you?"

4. **Know What You Can Offer**: Be aware of your company's policies and what flexibility you can offer, such as adjusted workloads, flexible schedules, or temporary work-from-home arrangements.

5. **Check In Regularly**: Keep in touch with the team member to see how they are coping and if further adjustments are needed. This shows that you care and helps you stay informed about their situation.

6. **Consider Workload**: Assess whether their reduced performance is affecting the team and clients. If necessary, temporarily redistribute some of their responsibilities to other team members, ensuring that those who take on extra work are recognized and rewarded.

7. **Be Transparent and Consistent**: Treat this situation with the same level of compassion and flexibility you would offer to any other team member in a similar situation. This builds trust and sets a precedent for handling future issues.

By following these steps, you can support your team member through their personal crisis while maintaining team productivity.

Answer: To address the situation where a team member's personal issues are affecting their work and the team's performance, consider the following approach:

1. **Private Conversation**: Arrange a private meeting with the team member to discuss your observations. Approach the conversation with empathy and concern, ensuring they feel supported rather than judged.

2. **Active Listening**: Allow the team member to share their situation if they are comfortable. Listen actively and show understanding of their challenges.

3. **Offer Support**: Discuss potential support options, such as flexible working hours, temporary workload adjustments, or access to employee assistance programs. Ensure they know that help is available.

4. **Set Clear Expectations**: While being supportive, it's important to communicate the impact on the team and the need for a plan to manage their responsibilities.

5. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Work together to develop a plan that addresses both their personal needs and work responsibilities. This might include delegating tasks or setting short-term goals.

6. **Regular Check-Ins**: Schedule follow-up meetings to monitor their progress and adjust the plan as needed. This shows ongoing support and helps in managing any further issues.

7. **Encourage Professional Help**: If appropriate, encourage them to seek professional help, such as counseling or therapy, to address their personal issues.

8. **Maintain Team Morale**: Communicate with the rest of the team to manage workload distribution and maintain morale, without breaching the affected team member's privacy.

By taking these steps, you can support the team member in overcoming their personal challenges while minimizing the impact on the team's performance.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/prevention/antibiotics/index.html

Antibiotics can prevent anthrax from developing in people who have been exposed but have not developed symptoms. Antibiotics work in two main ways, by killing the anthrax or by stopping the anthrax from growing. When the anthrax can’t grow anymore, it dies. Two of the antibiotics that could be used to prevent anthrax are:

Ciprofloxacin

Doxycycline

Each of these antibiotics offers the same protection against anthrax. Anthrax spores typically take 1 to 7 days to be activated, but some spores can remain inside the body and take up to 60 days or more before they are activated. Activated spores release toxins—or poisons—that attack the body, causing the person to become sick. That’s why people who have been exposed to anthrax must take antibiotics for 60 days. This will protect them from any anthrax spores in their body when the spores are activated.

 steel, titanium, or composites of different materials such as carbon fiber and polymers. These material’s sturdy, stiff, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant nature make them excellent for aircraft parts and components.Aluminum, in particular, is popular in aircraft manufacturing because it’s strong and has low density. However, since its strength diminishes at high temperatures, it isn’t used to make parts on an airplane’s skin surface. Most manufacturers add it to steel and titanium to increase the structural integrity of the plane parts while reducing weight.Steel is known for its strength because it’s an alloy of carbon and iron. Nonetheless, it’s heavier than aluminum and other materials used in airplane construction. For this reason, it’s excellent for use in the landing gear, thanks to its strength. Moreover, the skin surface of most airplanes is made out of steel due to its high heat resistance.Together with its alloys, titanium is preferred for its temperature

Answer: The different part requirements for flying parts made from aluminum, composite, steel, and titanium are as follows:

- **Aluminum**: Aluminum is popular in aircraft manufacturing due to its strength and low density. However, it loses strength at high temperatures, so it is not used for parts on an airplane's skin surface. It is often combined with steel and titanium to enhance structural integrity while reducing weight. Aluminum parts make up 80% of the aircraft's weight and may remain unpainted due to their anti-corrosion properties.

- **Composite Materials**: Composites are made from a combination of fibers (such as steel, glass, graphite, aluminum oxide, iron) and a matrix of metal alloys (aluminum, titanium, magnesium) or synthetic resins (epoxy, polyester). These materials are used for their ability to combine the properties of their constituent elements and acquire new characteristics, making them favorable for aircraft construction.

- **Steel**: Steel is known for its strength and is used in parts that require high strength, such as landing gear. It is heavier than aluminum and other materials but is excellent for use in areas that require high heat resistance, such as the skin surface of airplanes.

- **Titanium**: Titanium and its alloys are preferred for their temperature resistance. They are used in areas where high temperature and strength are required, contributing to the structural integrity of the aircraft.

Answer: Flying parts made from different materials have specific requirements based on their properties:

1. **Aluminium**: 
   - Aluminium is popular in aircraft manufacturing due to its strength and low density. 
   - It is used in parts where weight reduction is crucial, but it is not used for parts exposed to high temperatures, such as the aircraft skin, because its strength diminishes at high temperatures.
   - Aluminium parts make up a significant portion of an aircraft's weight (up to 80%) and may remain unpainted due to their anti-corrosion properties.

2. **Composite Materials**:
   - Composites are made from a combination of materials, such as fibres of steel, glass, graphite, and aluminium oxide, with a matrix of metal alloys or synthetic resins.
   - These materials are used for their ability to combine the properties of their constituents and acquire new characteristics, such as increased strength and reduced weight.
   - Composites are favored for their versatility and ability to be tailored to specific requirements.

3. **Steel**:
   - Steel is known for its strength and is used in parts where high strength is necessary, such as landing gear.
   - It is heavier than aluminium and other materials, which limits its use in weight-sensitive areas.
   - Steel is also used for the skin surface of airplanes due to its high heat resistance.

4. **Titanium**:
   - Titanium and its alloys are preferred for their temperature resistance and strength.
   - It is used in areas where high strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to high temperatures are required.
   - Titanium is often combined with other materials like aluminium to enhance structural integrity while keeping weight low.

Answer: The context provided does not directly compare cement and silica fume as standalone materials for construction. Instead, it highlights the role of micro-silica fume as an additive to cement in the construction industry. Micro-silica fume is noted for its high activity, water-reducing, and reinforcing properties, which make it valuable in enhancing the strength and density of concrete when used in combination with cement. Therefore, rather than choosing between cement and silica fume, the context suggests that using silica fume as an additive to cement can improve the overall properties of the construction material.

GraphRAG Score: 20Question: What is the best way to support a person living with dementia to remain in their own home when they have problems with night time waking, increased falls risk and no family support?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Helping dementia patients live at home is one of the best ways to encourage their health, longevity, and comfort. There are times when moving someone with dementia is necessary, but it’s often best to keep them at home.

There can be some worry and uncertainty regarding individuals with dementia living at home, especially if they’re alone. If you’re an adult child or family caregiver to someone with dementia, you may have lots of questions about your loved one living at home.

In this article, we’re sharing expert information about people with dementia living at home and how to get help for dementia sufferers living alone. We’ll answer some of the most pressing questions, like:

Can someone with dementia live alone?

How long can dementia patients live at home?

How can you promote independence in a person with dementia?

Keep reading to learn more about the risks and benefits of people with dementia staying at home.

The Top 5 Questions About People with Dementia Living at Home

Dementia is a disease that affects nearly 5 million Americans. As the population ages, experts expect that number to rise, and many people may find themselves as a caregiver to someone with dementia.

But dementia doesn’t immediately render someone unable to perform daily life tasks. Most people with dementia can still live for many years before they need serious hands-on assistance. And like most elderly adults, those with dementia want to age in the comfort of their own homes.

There are some potential risks to be aware of when thinking about letting your loved one with dementia live at home. However, there are also many benefits.

Here are the top five questions about individuals with dementia living at home.

1. Can Dementia Patients Live at Home?

People with dementia can live at home, especially in the early stages of dementia.

Dementia is a progressive disease, meaning that its symptoms get worse over time. One of the significant signs of dementia is short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss means they can often forget:

Where they placed things

New names or places

Scheduled events or appointments

They may need help remembering new information, but living at home isn’t a huge issue in the early stages of dementia.

Additionally, home is a place of comfort and certainty. The later stages of dementia can bring about confusion, wandering, and the risk of getting lost. Keeping individuals with dementia in their homes provides them with familiarity. This familiarity may include:

Places (i.e., stores and medical providers)

People (i.e., local friends and family)

Events and other appointments

Home is an excellent place for someone with dementia to remain, regardless of their dementia stage.

2. How Long Can Dementia Patients Live at Home?

Ultimately, someone with dementia can live at home until they pass away. However, it often requires that they receive full-time, hands-on help in the later stages of dementia.

As dementia progresses, it affects more than someone’s short-term memory. The late stages of dementia usually cause the person to lose motor functions and hinder their ability to live independently. This loss of function can lead them to need help:

Dressing

Bathing

Eating

Moving

A person with late-stage dementia often requires 24-hour hands-on assistance. This help can come from a family member who lives with their loved one or a full-time caregiver from an in-home care company.

But with 24-hour care, someone with dementia can live in their home indefinitely.

3. Can Someone with Dementia Live Alone?

This third question is a little complicated.

Dementia patients can technically live alone to some degree. However, they may need someone to check in with them regularly.

Family members could take shifts visiting with them a few days a week. There are also home monitoring devices for elderly adults that families can use. In-home caregivers provide another way to ensure your loved one receives regular, professional in-home help.

As dementia progresses, living alone becomes more complex. Dementia patients can easily:

Get lost

Wander

Become confused

Dementia also doesn’t progress at a consistent pace. One day your loved one may seem fine on their own. The next day, their condition could change, and they may need an increased level of care. It’s best to have a long-term care plan in place for when your loved one needs more serious care.

People with dementia might be able to live alone under specific circumstances. But should they live alone?

4. Should a Person with Dementia Live Alone?

Because of the nature of dementia, someone with dementia shouldn’t live alone.

As we mentioned above, rapid dementia progression can occur, and the ability for those with dementia to wander or get lost is always a possibility. Leaving someone with dementia alone also runs the risk of a medical emergency occurring without someone to help immediately.

Someone may not need to stay with your loved one 24-hours a day during the early stages. But as dementia progresses, it’s best to make sure they have more regular care. Eventually, most people with dementia do need supervision at all hours of the day.

24-hour care for a person with dementia could look like:

A family member staying with your loved one

Moving your loved one into your home

Getting a 24-hour in-home caregiver

Some combination of the above

Ultimately, helping dementia patients live at home well involves ensuring their safety and comfort. A person with dementia is most safe when they aren’t left alone.

5. How Can You Promote Independence in a Person with Dementia?

Even though it’s often not best to allow someone with dementia to live alone, you still want to promote independent living for as long as possible.

Independent living usually means providing a routine and encouraging your loved one to do simple daily tasks themself. These daily tasks might include:

Bathing and dressing

Cooking and cleaning

Exercising and walking

Socializing with friends

Creating and following a daily to-do list

Anything that keeps them active and thinking for themselves is beneficial. There may come a time when your loved one with dementia needs around-the-clock care. Until then, promote an independent lifestyle as much as possible.

In-home Care: Helping Dementia Patients Live at Home

Dementia is a progressive disease that slowly affects someone’s cognitive and physical abilities. The early stages of dementia bring about short-term memory loss, but people can still perform daily tasks independently. Dementia’s later stages often more seriously affect an individual, causing them to need more continual hands-on help with daily living.

However, it’s possible and encouraged for people with dementia to live at home. Their home is a safe place that provides them with comfort, familiarity, and security as dementia progresses.

It’s often not best to allow someone with dementia to stay at home alone, especially in dementia’s later stages. Helping dementia patients live at home usually involves having a family member or professional in-home caregiver remain with them. Towards the end of their life, a person with dementia usually needs 24-hour in-home care to stay at home.

At Stowell Associates, we make aging at home possible for elderly adults. Our highly-trained staff of Care Managers, Caregivers, and Care Coaches know how to take care of a person with dementia while also providing support to family members.

Care Managers work personally with family members to manage their loved one’s care and oversee a personalized care plan.

Caregivers enter your loved one’s home to provide the hands-on care they need.

Care Coaches provide tools, resources, and support to family caregivers who want to provide personal care to their loved ones themselves.

Contact us today to talk with a Care Advisor and receive assistance understanding what kind of care is best for your loved one with dementia.
Keeping safe is important for people with dementia who want to remain living at home, and for friends and family members who are supporting them.

How to keep safe at home when you have dementia

You may find you’re having difficulties keeping safe. For example, you might sometimes forget to turn the lights or oven off, or find it harder to use stairs. By making some changes, you can stay safe in your home and enjoy your independence for longer.

You might need to think a little bit more about how you do some things. There may be equipment or technology you can get or buy to help you with specific problems.

Where else can I get support to keep safe at home?

Your GP or staff at the memory clinic or social services can also give advice on staying safe at home. They may refer you to an occupational therapist, who can help you to think about how to do some of the things around the house that you’re finding difficult.

Answer: To support a person living with dementia to remain in their own home when they have problems with nighttime waking, increased falls risk, and no family support, it is important to consider the following strategies:

1. **In-home Caregiver**: Hiring a professional in-home caregiver can provide the necessary supervision and assistance, especially during nighttime when the person may wake up and be at risk of falls.

2. **Home Safety Modifications**: Implement safety modifications in the home to reduce fall risks, such as installing grab bars, removing tripping hazards, and ensuring adequate lighting.

3. **Technology and Equipment**: Utilize technology and equipment designed to assist with safety, such as motion-sensor lights, bed alarms, or wearable alert devices that can notify emergency services if a fall occurs.

4. **Routine and Structure**: Establish a consistent daily routine to help manage nighttime waking and provide a sense of security and predictability.

5. **Consult Professionals**: Seek advice from healthcare professionals, such as a GP or occupational therapist, who can provide tailored recommendations and support for managing specific challenges related to dementia.

6. **Community Resources**: Explore community resources or services that offer support for individuals with dementia, such as adult day programs or respite care services.

By implementing these strategies, a person with dementia can maintain their independence and safety while living at home, even in the absence of family support.

There are times when moving someone with dementia is necessary, but it’s often best to keep them at home.\\n\\nThere can be some worry and uncertainty regarding individuals with dementia living at home, especially if they’re alone. If you’re an adult child or family caregiver to someone with dementia, you may have lots of questions about your loved one living at home.\\n\\nIn this article, we’re sharing expert information about people with dementia living at home and how to get help for dementia sufferers living alone. We’ll answer some of the most pressing questions, like:\\n\\nCan someone with dementia live alone?\\n\\nHow long can dementia patients live at home?\\n\\nHow can you promote independence in a person with dementia?\\n\\nKeep reading to learn more about the risks and benefits of people with dementia staying at home.\\n\\nThe Top 5 Questions About People with Dementia Living at Home\\n\\nDementia is a disease that affects nearly 5 million Americans. As the population ages, experts expect that number to rise, and many people may find themselves as a caregiver to someone with dementia.\\n\\nBut dementia doesn’t immediately render someone unable to perform daily life tasks. Most people with dementia can still live for many years before they need serious hands-on assistance. And like most elderly adults, those with dementia want to age in the comfort of their own homes.\\n\\nThere are some potential risks to be aware of when thinking about letting your loved one with dementia live at home. However, there are also many benefits.\\n\\nHere are the top five questions about individuals with dementia living at home.\\n\\n1. Can Dementia Patients Live at Home?\\n\\nPeople with dementia can live at home, especially in the early stages of dementia.\\n\\nDementia is a progressive disease, meaning that its symptoms get worse over time. One of the significant signs of dementia is short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss means they can often forget:\\n\\nWhere they placed things\\n\\nNew names or places\\n\\nScheduled events or appointments\\n\\nThey may need help remembering new information, but living at home isn’t a huge issue in the early stages of dementia.\\n\\nAdditionally, home is a place of comfort and certainty. The later stages of dementia can bring about confusion, wandering, and the risk of getting lost. Keeping individuals with dementia in their homes provides them with familiarity. This familiarity may include:\\n\\nPlaces (i.e., stores and medical providers)\\n\\nPeople (i.e., local friends and family)\\n\\nEvents and other appointments\\n\\nHome is an excellent place for someone with dementia to remain, regardless of their dementia stage.\\n\\n2. How Long Can Dementia Patients Live at Home?\\n\\nUltimately, someone with dementia can live at home until they pass away. However, it often requires that they receive full-time, hands-on help in the later stages of dementia.\\n\\nAs dementia progresses, it affects more than someone’s short-term memory. The late stages of dementia usually cause the person to lose motor functions and hinder their ability to live independently. This loss of function can lead them to need help:\\n\\nDressing\\n\\nBathing\\n\\nEating\\n\\nMoving\\n\\nA person with late-stage dementia often requires 24-hour hands-on assistance. This help can come from a family member who lives with their loved one or a full-time caregiver from an in-home care company.\\n\\nBut with 24-hour care, someone with dementia can live in their home indefinitely.\\n\\n3. Can Someone with Dementia Live Alone?\\n\\nThis third question is a little complicated.\\n\\nDementia patients can technically live alone to some degree. However, they may need someone to check in with them regularly.\\n\\nFamily members could take shifts visiting with them a few days a week. There are also home monitoring devices for elderly adults that families can use. In-home caregivers provide another way to ensure your loved one receives regular, professional in-home help.\\n\\nAs dementia progresses, living alone becomes more complex. Dementia patients can easily:\\n\\nGet lost\\n\\nWander\\n\\nBecome confused\\n\\nDementia also doesn’t progress at a consistent pace. One day your loved one may seem fine on their own. The next day, their condition could change, and they may need an increased level of care. It’s best to have a long-term care plan in place for when your loved one needs more serious care.\\n\\nPeople with dementia might be able to live alone under specific circumstances. But should they live alone?\\n\\n4. Should a Person with Dementia Live Alone?\\n\\nBecause of the nature of dementia, someone with dementia shouldn’t live alone.\\n\\nAs we mentioned above, rapid dementia progression can occur, and the ability for those with dementia to wander or get lost is always a possibility. Leaving someone with dementia alone also runs the risk of a medical emergency occurring without someone to help immediately.\\n\\nSomeone may not need to stay with your loved one 24-hours a day during the early stages. But as dementia progresses, it’s best to make sure they have more regular care. Eventually, most people with dementia do need supervision at all hours of the day.\\n\\n24-hour care for a person with dementia could look like:\\n\\nA family member staying with your loved one\\n\\nMoving your loved one into your home\\n\\nGetting a 24-hour in-home caregiver\\n\\nSome combination of the above\\n\\nUltimately, helping dementia patients live at home well involves ensuring their safety and comfort. A person with dementia is most safe when they aren’t left alone.\\n\\n5. How Can You Promote Independence in a Person with Dementia?\\n\\nEven though it’s often not best to allow someone with dementia to live alone, you still want to promote independent living for as long as possible.\\n\\nIndependent living usually means providing a routine and encouraging your loved one to do simple daily tasks themself. These daily tasks might include:\\n\\nBathing and dressing\\n\\nCooking and cleaning\\n\\nExercising and walking\\n\\nSocializing with friends\\n\\nCreating and following a daily to-do list\\n\\nAnything that keeps them active and thinking for themselves is beneficial. There may come a time when your loved one with dementia needs around-the-clock care. Until then, promote an independent lifestyle as much as possible.\\n\\nIn-home Care: Helping Dementia Patients Live at Home\\n\\nDementia is a progressive disease that slowly affects someone’s cognitive and physical abilities. The early stages of dementia bring about short-term memory loss, but people can still perform daily tasks independently. Dementia’s later stages often more seriously affect an individual, causing them to need more continual hands-on help with daily living.\\n\\nHowever, it’s possible and encouraged for people with dementia to live at home. Their home is a safe place that provides them with comfort, familiarity, and security as dementia progresses.\\n\\nIt’s often not best to allow someone with dementia to stay at home alone, especially in dementia’s later stages.

Answer: To support a person living with dementia to remain in their own home, especially when they have problems with nighttime waking, an increased risk of falls, and no family support, consider the following strategies:

1. **Professional In-Home Care**: Hire a professional caregiver who can provide 24-hour support, especially during the night, to ensure safety and assistance when needed.

2. **Home Safety Modifications**: Make necessary modifications to the home to reduce fall risks, such as installing grab bars, removing tripping hazards, and ensuring adequate lighting.

3. **Technology and Monitoring Devices**: Use home monitoring devices and technology to track movements and alert caregivers or emergency services if the person gets up at night or falls.

4. **Routine and Environment**: Establish a consistent daily routine to help manage nighttime waking and create a calming environment to promote better sleep.

5. **Medical and Professional Support**: Consult with healthcare professionals, such as a GP or occupational therapist, for personalized advice and to address any underlying medical issues contributing to nighttime waking or falls.

6. **Community Resources**: Explore community resources and support services that can provide additional assistance and companionship.

These measures can help maintain the person's independence and safety while living at home.

 and possibly during other modifications with similar time scales. Due to low natural abundance of 13C it might be necessary to synthesize 13C-enhanced samples in order to obtain suitable spectra with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Similar principles could be used to follow the annealing process of carbon nano materials. C 60 will not be discussed herein.Lanthanide Shift Reagents Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is the most powerful tool for organic and organometallic compound determination. Even structures can be determined just using this technique. In general NMR gives information about the number of magnetically distinct atoms of the specific nuclei under study, as well as information regarding the nature of the immediate environment surrounding each nuclei. Because hydrogen and carbon are the major components of organic and organometallic compounds, proton (1H) NMR and carbon-13 (13C) NMR are the most useful nuclei to observe.

Answer: To determine the product formed after catalysis on an NMR without using standards, one can analyze the NMR spectra to obtain information about the number of magnetically distinct atoms of the specific nuclei under study, as well as the nature of the immediate environment surrounding each nucleus. By examining the chemical shifts, coupling patterns, and integration of the peaks in the NMR spectrum, one can infer the structure of the product. Additionally, techniques such as the nuclear Overhauser effect can be used to investigate the stereochemistry or conformation of the product. This approach allows for the determination of the product's structure based on the NMR data alone, without the need for comparison to known standards.

Answer: To determine the product formed after catalysis using NMR without standards, one can analyze the NMR spectrum to identify unique chemical shifts, coupling patterns, and integration values that correspond to the expected structure of the product. By understanding the expected chemical environment of the product's protons or carbons, one can infer the structure based on the observed NMR data. Additionally, techniques such as the nuclear Overhauser effect can provide information on spatial proximity of atoms, aiding in the determination of stereochemistry or conformation. Comparing these observations with known reaction mechanisms and expected outcomes can help confirm the identity of the product.

Answer: To develop and maintain an effective project schedule, follow these practical steps:

1. **Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks to organize and define the total scope of the project.

2. **Estimate Durations:** Determine how long each task will take to complete. This involves assessing the time required for each task based on available information and past experiences.

3. **Determine Resources:** Identify the resources needed for each task, including personnel, equipment, and materials. This helps in allocating the right resources to the right tasks.

4. **Identify Predecessors:** Determine the sequence of tasks by identifying which tasks need to be completed before others can start. This helps in understanding task dependencies and scheduling them accordingly.

5. **Determine Milestones:** Set key milestones throughout the project timeline to track progress and ensure that the project is on schedule. Milestones are significant points or events in the project.

6. **Identify Dependencies:** Recognize the relationships between tasks to understand how they impact each other. This helps in managing the project schedule effectively by ensuring that dependent tasks are aligned.

By following these steps, you can create a project schedule that is realistic, achievable, and allows for effective project management.

You can’t expect someone to be at their best at such times. But as a manager what can you expect? How can you support the person to take care of themselves emotionally while also making sure they are doing their work (or as much of it as they are able to)?\\n\\nWhat the Experts Say\\n\\nManaging an employee who is going through a stressful period is “one of the real challenges all bosses face,” says Linda Hill, professor at Harvard Business School and author of Being the Boss. Most of us try to keep work and home separate, but “we all have situations in which our personal and professional lives collide,” and how you handle these situations with your employees is often a test of your leadership. You need to be empathetic and compassionate while also being professional and keeping your team productive. It’s a fine line to maintain, says Annie McKee, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education and author of How to Be Happy at Work. Here’s how to manage an employee going through a personal crisis.\\n\\nMake yourself available\\n\\n“People don’t always feel comfortable telling their boss” that a parent is gravely ill or that they feel stressed out in the wake of a crumbling relationship, says McKee. They may be too overwhelmed, or embarrassed that it is causing them to be late repeatedly or to miss deadlines. Often a manager’s first challenge is simply recognizing the warning signs that an employee is going through a difficult time. Invest time in building good relationships with employees so you’ll be able to detect any problems early on. If you maintain an atmosphere of compassion in the office, people are more likely to proactively come to you when they’re going through a tough period.\\n\\nDon’t pry\\n\\nAs a leader, you need to be able to show empathy and care, but you also must avoid becoming an employee’s personal confidante. After all, your job as manager is not to be the office shrink. So don’t ask a bunch of questions about the employee’s problems. As the person with more power in the relationship, the employee may feel compelled to tell you more than they’re comfortable with. “You want to build a caring relationship with employees, not a friendly relationship,” says Hill. Many managers make the mistake of confusing being liked with being trusted or respected. A good manager “has the ability to read and understand other people’s needs and concerns,” says McKee, while still keeping everyone focused on the major task at hand: accomplishing work.\\n\\nListen first, suggest second\\n\\nWhen you speak to an employee about their current struggles, “listen first instead of immediately advocating for some particular course of action,” says Hill. They may just want a sounding board about the difficulties of caring for a sick relative or an opportunity to explain why a divorce has affected their attention span. If you immediately suggest they take a leave of absence or adjust their schedule, they may be put off if that’s not what they were thinking. Instead, ask what both of you can do together to address the issue of performance during the difficult period. “Try to use the word ‘we,’” advises Hill, as in “How can we support you?” The employee may have an idea for a temporary arrangement — some time off, handing off a project to a colleague, or a more flexible schedule for a few weeks — that is amenable to you.\\n\\nKnow what you can offer\\n\\nYou may be more than willing to give a grieving employee several weeks of leave, or to offer a woman with a high-risk pregnancy the ability to work from home. But the decision isn’t always yours to make. “You may be very compassionate but you may be in a company where that’s not the way it works,” says Hill. Of course, if you have the leeway to get creative with a flexible schedule, an adjusted workload, or a temporary work-from-home arrangement, do what you think is best. But also be sure you understand your company’s restrictions on short- and long-term leave, and what, if any, bureaucratic hurdles exist before promising anything to your employee. Explain that you need to check what’s possible before you both commit to an arrangement.\\n\\nIf the employee needs counseling or drug or alcohol services, there may be resources provided by your company’s medical insurance that you can recommend. But investigate the quality of those resources first. “The last thing you want to do is send a suffering employee to avail themselves of a program or supposedly helpful people who then fall short,” says McKee.\\n\\nCheck in regularly to make sure they’re doing ok\\n\\nWhether you’ve settled on a solution yet or not, check in with your employee occasionally by dropping by their desk (keeping their privacy in mind) or sending a brief email. Not only will your employee appreciate that you care, you’ll get a better sense of how they are coping. “You can simply ask, ‘Do you feel like you’ve got a handle on it?,’” says Hill. “And if they do, you can say, ‘Let’s just keep in touch so neither one of us has too many surprises. Or if you get a little over your head, I hope you’ll feel free to come to me and we can do some more problem solving and make further adjustments if necessary.’”\\n\\nConsider workload\\n\\nYou also have to consider whether prolonged absences will adversely affect clients or team members. If so, mitigate those risks by easing the person’s workload. If there are people who are willing and able to take on some of the individual’s projects, you can do that temporarily. Just be sure to reward the people who are stepping in. And then set timelines for any adjustments you make. If the person knows that their situation will last for 6-8 weeks, set a deadline for you to meet and discuss what will happen next. Of course, many situations will be open-ended and in those cases, you can set interim deadlines when you get together to check in on how things are going and make adjustments as necessary. Whatever arrangements you make, be crystal clear about your expectations during this time period. Be realistic about what they can accomplish and set goals they can meet. “For this to be useful,” says McKee, “it’s got to be specific and it has be grounded in reality.”\\n\\nBe transparent and consistent\\n\\nBe conscious of the fact that other employees will take note of how you treat the struggling colleague and will likely expect similar consideration if they too run into difficult times in the future. “If you want to get productive work out of people, they need to trust you and believe that you’ll treat them fairly,” says Hill. Remember that policies may be precedent-setting. Every situation will be unique, but you want to be comfortable with policies in case you are called to apply them again. Keep in mind that solutions could apply to “the next person and the next and the next after that,” says McKee.\\n\\nPrinciples to Remember\\n\\nDo:\\n\\nSet a tone of compassion in the office. It will not only give your employees confidence to approach you with struggles, but also give you the ability to spot warnings signs.\\n\\nBe creative with solutions. A flexible schedule may allow a person to maintain their output without much disruption.\\n\\nCheck in from time to time, both to reassure the employee and to make sure that further adjustments or accommodations aren’t needed.\\n\\nDon’t:\\n\\nAct more like a therapist than a manager. Your heart may be in the right place, but don’t get involved in your employee’s personal problems.\\n\\nMake promises you can’t keep. Research your company’s policies before you offer time off or alternative work arrangements.\\n\\nTreat similar situations among employees differently. Employees will note — and resent — the inconsistency.\\n\\nCase Study #1: Set realistic work goals with the employee and delegate some of their work\\n\\nAlicia Shankland, a senior HR executive with more than 20 years of experience, managed two different women through the intensely stressful, emotional months of fertility treatment.

Answer: To develop and maintain an effective project schedule, follow these practical steps:

1. **Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks to organize and define the total scope of the project.

2. **Estimate Durations:** Determine how long each task will take to complete. This involves assessing the time required for each task based on past experience or expert judgment.

3. **Determine Resources:** Identify the resources needed for each task, including personnel, equipment, and materials.

4. **Identify Predecessors:** Determine the sequence of tasks by identifying which tasks must be completed before others can begin.

5. **Determine Milestones:** Set key milestones to track progress and ensure that the project is on schedule.

6. **Identify Dependencies:** Recognize dependencies between tasks to understand how they impact the project timeline.

By following these steps, you can create a project schedule that is realistic, achievable, and allows for effective project management.

and allow friends and loved ones to express their love and duty to those who die. Under circumstances in which a person has been lost and presumed dead or when family members were unable to attend a funeral, there can continue to be a lack of closure that makes it difficult to grieve and to learn to live with loss. And although many people are still in shock when they attend funerals, the ceremony still provides a marker of the beginning of a new period of one’s life as a survivor.

The Body After Death In most cultures, after the last offices have been performed and before the onset of significant decay, relations or friends arrange for ritual disposition of the body, either by destruction, or by preservation, or in a secondary use. In the U.S., this frequently means either cremation or interment in a tomb. There are various methods of destroying human remains, depending on religious or spiritual beliefs, and upon practical necessity. Cremation is a very old and quite common custom.

and transport live animals because it’s essential to avoid disturbing the animals. Unauthorized personnel must avoid approaching or disturbing the live animals at all times. Food and water should be given according to handling instructions, and proper ventilation should always be available. If necessary, appropriate steps should be taken to remove sick or deceased animals.

After off-loading the live animals, the airline animal containers and aircraft holds must be cleaned and disinfected.



Loading





Live animals should only be loaded according to their specific needs and placed in suitable aircraft compartments. Their containers should always be handled and stowed in the direction as indicated on the labels placed on the container. They should be loaded according to guidelines found within the IATA Live Animals Regulations (LAR) manual. Precautions should be taken to ensure other loads do not shift or fall on live animal containers during transport. Netting can also be used to
Answer: The context provided does not specifically address whether live animals can sense dead bodies or if there is an emotional weight associated with stowing human remains separately from live animals. It only discusses the handling and transportation of live animals and the ritual disposition of human remains. Therefore, based on the given information, there is no evidence or mention of live animals being able to sense dead bodies or any emotional weight associated with this practice.

Answer: The context provided does not directly address the question about whether human remains should be stowed separately from live animals due to the belief that animals can sense dead bodies. The context focuses on the importance of maintaining separation between known and unknown samples in a DNA laboratory to prevent cross-contamination, which is crucial for ensuring the integrity of DNA analysis results. 

However, the principle of maintaining separation to prevent contamination or interference can be loosely related to the idea of keeping human remains separate from live animals. While the context does not provide scientific evidence regarding animals' ability to sense dead bodies, it suggests that maintaining separation can be important in certain situations to ensure the integrity of the process or environment. In the case of human remains and live animals, adhering to separation might be more about respecting cultural or emotional beliefs rather than a scientifically proven necessity.

Mediterranean diet for heart health The Mediterranean diet is a healthy-eating plan. It's focused on plants and includes the traditional flavors and cooking methods of the region. By Mayo Clinic Staff

If you're looking for a heart-healthy eating plan, the Mediterranean diet might be right for you. It's less of a diet, meaning a restricted way to eat, and more of a lifestyle.

It blends the basics of healthy eating with the traditional flavors and cooking methods of the people in the Mediterranean region.

Why the Mediterranean diet?

Diet is known to have an effect on long-term diseases. These include heart and blood vessel problems known as cardiovascular disease. Observations from a study in the 1960s found that cardiovascular disease was linked to fewer deaths in some Mediterranean countries, such as Greece and Italy, than in the U.S. and northern Europe.

More-recent studies linked the Mediterranean diet with lower risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure.

Today, the Mediterranean diet is one of the healthy eating plans that American nutrition experts recommend. It's also recognized by the World Health Organization as a healthy-eating pattern.

Many cultures have eating patterns similar to the Mediterranean diet, including Japan, for example.

And other diets have some of the same recommendations as the Mediterranean diet. Two examples are the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Research suggests that it's key to follow the Mediterranean diet over the long term for your heart to benefit.

What is the Mediterranean diet?

The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating based on the traditional cuisine of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. There's no single definition for the diet. But most often, it's high in:

Vegetables.

Fruits.

Whole grains.

Beans.

Nuts and seeds.

Olive oil.

Seasoning with herbs and spices.

The main steps to follow the diet include:

Each day, eat vegetables, fruits, whole grains and plant-based fats.

Each week, have fish, poultry, beans, legumes and eggs.

Enjoy moderate portions of dairy products.

Limit how much red meat you eat.

Limit how many foods with added sugar you eat.

Some other elements of the Mediterranean diet are to:

Share meals with family and friends.

Get regular exercise.

Enjoy wine in moderation if you drink alcohol.

Plant based, not meat based

The foundation of the Mediterranean diet is plant foods. That means meals are built around vegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans and whole grains.

Moderate amounts of dairy, poultry and eggs are part of the Mediterranean diet, as is seafood. In contrast, red meat is eaten only once in a while.

Healthy fats

Unsaturated fats are a strength of the Mediterranean diet. They're eaten instead of saturated and trans fats, which play roles in heart disease.

Olive oil and nuts are the main sources of fat in the Mediterranean diet. They provide unsaturated fat. When unsaturated fat comes from plant sources, it seems to lower levels of total cholesterol as well as low-density lipoprotein, also called LDL or "bad" cholesterol.

Replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat lowers risk of cardiovascular disease events and death related to cardiovascular disease, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Seafood, seeds, nuts, legumes and some vegetable oils have healthy fats, including the polyunsaturated kind.

Fish also are a key part of the Mediterranean diet. Some healthy choices are:

Mackerel.

Herring.

Sardines.

Albacore tuna.

Salmon.

Anchovies.

These are known as fatty fish. And the fats they contain are omega-3 fatty acids.

Omega-3s are unsaturated fats that may lower immune system action in the body known as inflammation. They also may help reduce blood fats called triglycerides, and they affect blood clotting. Omega 3s may lower the risk of stroke and heart failure too.

Lean fish and shellfish also are included in the Mediterranean diet. Shellfish include shrimp, crab, clams and scallops. Some types of lean fish are cod, haddock, hake and whitefish.

Choose fish that are low in mercury, such as the ones listed above. This is important for children ages 1 to 11 and people who are pregnant and breastfeeding.

Too much mercury can harm the brain and nervous system over time. If your family catches and eats fish, check local fish advisories to find out about any cases of mercury contamination.

What about wine?

Like people all over the world, some who live in the Mediterranean region drink alcohol and some do not. Many versions of the Mediterranean diet include some wine with a meal.

Red wine tends to be included more often than is white wine. Some experts and dietary guidelines recommend that women limit themselves to one glass of wine a day, and for men no more than two glasses a day.

Alcohol has been linked with a lower risk of heart disease in some studies. But it's not risk-free. So don't start to drink alcohol or drink more often in hopes of gaining possible health benefits.

Recent studies cast doubt on the notion that even a little alcohol may be good for the heart.

One large study suggested that people who regularly drank any amount of alcohol had a higher risk of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease. The more alcohol they drank, the higher the risk.

Another study found that having slightly more than one alcoholic drink a day was linked with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat.

If you drink alcohol, talk to your health care provider or a specialist in nutrition, called a dietitian, to figure out what amount — if any — is right for you.

Factors that affect your decision might be the extra calories alcohol brings to the diet, or any kidney or liver problems you may have. And if you just don't like the taste of alcohol, that's a good reason to stay away from it too.

Eating the Mediterranean way

Want to try the Mediterranean diet? These tips will help you get started:

Eat more fruits and vegetables. Each day, aim for 2 to 3 servings of fruit and four or more servings of vegetables. One serving of fruit equals a medium piece of whole fruit or one cup of chopped. One serving of vegetables equals two cups of leafy produce, one cup of raw veggies, or half a cup of cooked vegetables.

Each day, aim for 2 to 3 servings of fruit and four or more servings of vegetables. One serving of fruit equals a medium piece of whole fruit or one cup of chopped. One serving of vegetables equals two cups of leafy produce, one cup of raw veggies, or half a cup of cooked vegetables. Choose whole grains. Switch to whole-grain bread, cereal and pasta. You also can try other whole grains, such as bulgur, barley and farro. If you eat about 2,000 calories a day, aim to have at least 3 ounces of whole grains. You can get 1 ounce from a slice of bread, a cup of ready-made cereal, or half a cup of cooked rice or pasta. Read the Nutrition Facts label to find out how much of a product is in one serving.

Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats may help lower the risk of heart disease. For example, you could replace butter with olive, canola, or safflower or sunflower oil in cooking or at the table. And instead of putting butter or margarine on bread, you could use nut or seed spreads on toast or on an apple.

Children and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding may want to limit certain types of fish due to mercury levels. One serving of fish is around 3 to 5 ounces for adults. That's about the size of a deck of cards. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends smaller servings for children twice a week.

Building a Healthy and Balanced Diet

Make most of your meal vegetables and fruits – ½ of your plate.

Aim for color and variety, and remember that potatoes don’t count as vegetables on the Healthy Eating Plate because of their negative impact on blood sugar.

Go for whole grains – ¼ of your plate.

Whole and intact grains—whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, quinoa, oats, brown rice, and foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta—have a milder effect on blood sugar and insulin than white bread, white rice, and other refined grains.

Protein power – ¼ of your plate.

Fish, poultry, beans, and nuts are all healthy, versatile protein sources—they can be mixed into salads, and pair well with vegetables on a plate. Limit red meat, and avoid processed meats such as bacon and sausage.

Healthy plant oils – in moderation.

Choose healthy vegetable oils like olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and others, and avoid partially hydrogenated oils, which contain unhealthy trans fats. Remember that low-fat does not mean “healthy.”

Drink water, coffee, or tea.

Skip sugary drinks, limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day, and limit juice to a small glass per day.

Stay active.

The red figure running across the Healthy Eating Plate’s placemat is a reminder that staying active is also important in weight control.

The main message of the Healthy Eating Plate is to focus on diet quality:

The type of carbohydrate in the diet is more important than the amount of carbohydrate in the diet, because some sources of carbohydrate—like vegetables (other than potatoes), fruits, whole grains, and beans—are healthier than others.

The Healthy Eating Plate also advises consumers to avoid sugary beverages, a major source of calories—usually with little nutritional value—in the American diet.

The Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to use healthy oils, and it does not set a maximum on the percentage of calories people should get each day from healthy sources of fat. In this way, the Healthy Eating Plate recommends the opposite of the low-fat message promoted for decades by the USDA.

Your Plate and the Planet Just as different foods can have differing impacts on human health, they also have differing impacts on the environment. Food production is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and it places an enormous demand upon our earth’s natural resources. Learn about the impacts of the foods on your plate

Your Questions Answered

Are the relative sizes of the Healthy Eating Plate sections based on calories or volume?

The Healthy Eating Plate does not define a certain number of calories or servings per day from each food group. The relative section sizes suggest approximate relative proportions of each of the food groups to include on a healthy plate. They are not based on specific calorie amounts, and they are not meant to prescribe a certain number of calories or servings per day, since individuals’ calorie and nutrient needs vary based on age, gender, body size, and level of activity.

How can I apply this guide if I don’t eat my meals from a single plate? As the name suggests, the Healthy Eating Plate is visualized as a single plate, however it can be used as a guide for creating healthy, balanced meals—no matter which type of dishware is used! For example, while you wouldn’t consume soup on a plate—you can consider the relative sizes of each section when choosing what to add to the pot before serving in a bowl: make about half of your ingredients a variety of colorful vegetables (carrots, celery, spinach, tomatoes, sautéed in olive oil), and the other half a mix of whole grains (such as farro) and a healthy protein (such as beans).

Or maybe you’re eating your meal in courses, or as multiple dishes in smaller sizes: a plate of grilled fish over brown rice; a green side salad filled with veggies; and some fruit for a sweet end to the meal.

Portioning a meal into separate components is also common when packing a lunchbox—especially for kids. There are many cultures around the world in which people may not eat their meals from a plate. Although our translations of this guide maintain the single-plate graphic, we encourage its use for creating healthy, balanced meals in context of cultural and individual customs and preferences.

What about alcohol? Isn’t alcohol supposed to be good for you in small amounts?

For some people, moderate alcohol consumption can offer health benefits, whereas for others alcohol may pose risks. Learn more about the risks and benefits of alcohol.

Who created the Healthy Eating Plate? The Healthy Eating Plate, created by nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and editors at Harvard Health Publications, was designed to address deficiencies in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s MyPlate. The Healthy Eating Plate provides detailed guidance, in a simple format, to help people make the best eating choices. The Healthy Eating Plate is based exclusively on the best available science and was not subjected to political or commercial pressures from food industry lobbyists. Learn more about how the Healthy Eating Plate compares to the USDA’s MyPlate.

What about the Healthy Eating Pyramid? Will it be going away?

Generations of Americans are accustomed to the food pyramid design, and it’s not going away. In fact, the Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate complement each other. See how you can use the Healthy Eating Pyramid as a guide for your grocery shopping list.

Will following the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate guidelines really make me healthier?

According to research done at Harvard Chan School of Public Health and elsewhere [1-3], following the guidelines presented through the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate can lead to a lower risk of heart disease and premature death: In the 1990s, the USDA’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion created the Healthy Eating Index “to measure how well American diets conform to recommended healthy eating patterns.”  A score of 100 meant following the federal recommendations to the letter while a score of 0 meant totally ignoring them.

To see how well the principles embodied in the Healthy Eating Pyramid stacked up against the government’s advice, researchers at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health created an Alternate Healthy Eating Index with a scoring system similar to the USDA’s index. They then compared the two indexes, using information about daily diets collected from more than 100,000 female nurses and male health professionals taking part in two long-term studies. The eleven components assessed by the Alternate Healthy Eating Index were dairy products; vegetables; fruit; nuts & seeds; bread/grains; meat, poultry & fish; cholesterol; fat; sodium; alcohol; and multivitamins. Men who scored highest on the USDA’s original Healthy Eating Index (meaning their diets most closely followed federal recommendations) reduced their overall risk of developing heart disease, cancer, or other chronic disease by 11% over 8 to 12 years of follow-up compared to those who scored lowest. Women who most closely followed the government’s recommendations were only 3% less likely to have developed a chronic disease.  In comparison, scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index did appear to correlate more closely with better health in both sexes. Men with high scores (those whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid guidelines) were 20% less likely to have developed a major chronic disease than those with low scores. Women with high scores lowered their overall risk by 11%. Men whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid lowered their risk of cardiovascular disease by almost 40%; women with high scores lowered their risk by almost 30%. In a 2014 study looking at trends in diet quality among adults in the U.S., researchers using the Alternate Healthy Eating Index found that there was steady improvement from 1999 to 2010, but that overall dietary quality remains poor. 

Two studies offer further evidence of the disease prevention benefits that accrue from following a diet similar to one based on the Healthy Eating Pyramid: A study that tracked 7,319 British civil servants for 18 years found that men and women with the highest scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index had a 25% lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 42% lower risk of dying from heart disease, than people with the lowest scores. 

Another observational study in 93,676 post-menopausal women found that following a Healthy Eating Pyramid-style diet (as measured by adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index) was superior to following a low-fat diet at lowering cardiovascular disease and heart failure risk.

It\\\'s focused on plants and includes the traditional flavors and cooking methods of the region. By Mayo Clinic Staff\\n\\nIf you\\\'re looking for a heart-healthy eating plan, the Mediterranean diet might be right for you. It\\\'s less of a diet, meaning a restricted way to eat, and more of a lifestyle.\\n\\nIt blends the basics of healthy eating with the traditional flavors and cooking methods of the people in the Mediterranean region.\\n\\nWhy the Mediterranean diet?\\n\\nDiet is known to have an effect on long-term diseases. These include heart and blood vessel problems known as cardiovascular disease. Observations from a study in the 1960s found that cardiovascular disease was linked to fewer deaths in some Mediterranean countries, such as Greece and Italy, than in the U.S. and northern Europe.\\n\\nMore-recent studies linked the Mediterranean diet with lower risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure.\\n\\nToday, the Mediterranean diet is one of the healthy eating plans that American nutrition experts recommend. It\\\'s also recognized by the World Health Organization as a healthy-eating pattern.\\n\\nMany cultures have eating patterns similar to the Mediterranean diet, including Japan, for example.\\n\\nAnd other diets have some of the same recommendations as the Mediterranean diet. Two examples are the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\\n\\nResearch suggests that it\\\'s key to follow the Mediterranean diet over the long term for your heart to benefit.\\n\\nWhat is the Mediterranean diet?\\n\\nThe Mediterranean diet is a way of eating based on the traditional cuisine of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. There\\\'s no single definition for the diet. But most often, it\\\'s high in:\\n\\nVegetables.\\n\\nFruits.\\n\\nWhole grains.\\n\\nBeans.\\n\\nNuts and seeds.\\n\\nOlive oil.\\n\\nSeasoning with herbs and spices.\\n\\nThe main steps to follow the diet include:\\n\\nEach day, eat vegetables, fruits, whole grains and plant-based fats.\\n\\nEach week, have fish, poultry, beans, legumes and eggs.\\n\\nEnjoy moderate portions of dairy products.\\n\\nLimit how much red meat you eat.\\n\\nLimit how many foods with added sugar you eat.\\n\\nSome other elements of the Mediterranean diet are to:\\n\\nShare meals with family and friends.\\n\\nGet regular exercise.\\n\\nEnjoy wine in moderation if you drink alcohol.\\n\\nPlant based, not meat based\\n\\nThe foundation of the Mediterranean diet is plant foods. That means meals are built around vegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans and whole grains.\\n\\nModerate amounts of dairy, poultry and eggs are part of the Mediterranean diet, as is seafood. In contrast, red meat is eaten only once in a while.\\n\\nHealthy fats\\n\\nUnsaturated fats are a strength of the Mediterranean diet. They\\\'re eaten instead of saturated and trans fats, which play roles in heart disease.\\n\\nOlive oil and nuts are the main sources of fat in the Mediterranean diet. They provide unsaturated fat. When unsaturated fat comes from plant sources, it seems to lower levels of total cholesterol as well as low-density lipoprotein, also called LDL or "bad" cholesterol.\\n\\nReplacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat lowers risk of cardiovascular disease events and death related to cardiovascular disease, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\\n\\nSeafood, seeds, nuts, legumes and some vegetable oils have healthy fats, including the polyunsaturated kind.\\n\\nFish also are a key part of the Mediterranean diet. Some healthy choices are:\\n\\nMackerel.\\n\\nHerring.\\n\\nSardines.\\n\\nAlbacore tuna.\\n\\nSalmon.\\n\\nAnchovies.\\n\\nThese are known as fatty fish. And the fats they contain are omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nOmega-3s are unsaturated fats that may lower immune system action in the body known as inflammation. They also may help reduce blood fats called triglycerides, and they affect blood clotting. Omega 3s may lower the risk of stroke and heart failure too.\\n\\nLean fish and shellfish also are included in the Mediterranean diet. Shellfish include shrimp, crab, clams and scallops. Some types of lean fish are cod, haddock, hake and whitefish.\\n\\nChoose fish that are low in mercury, such as the ones listed above. This is important for children ages 1 to 11 and people who are pregnant and breastfeeding.\\n\\nToo much mercury can harm the brain and nervous system over time. If your family catches and eats fish, check local fish advisories to find out about any cases of mercury contamination.\\n\\nWhat about wine?\\n\\nLike people all over the world, some who live in the Mediterranean region drink alcohol and some do not. Many versions of the Mediterranean diet include some wine with a meal.\\n\\nRed wine tends to be included more often than is white wine. Some experts and dietary guidelines recommend that women limit themselves to one glass of wine a day, and for men no more than two glasses a day.\\n\\nAlcohol has been linked with a lower risk of heart disease in some studies. But it\\\'s not risk-free. So don\\\'t start to drink alcohol or drink more often in hopes of gaining possible health benefits.\\n\\nRecent studies cast doubt on the notion that even a little alcohol may be good for the heart.\\n\\nOne large study suggested that people who regularly drank any amount of alcohol had a higher risk of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease. The more alcohol they drank, the higher the risk.\\n\\nAnother study found that having slightly more than one alcoholic drink a day was linked with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat.\\n\\nIf you drink alcohol, talk to your health care provider or a specialist in nutrition, called a dietitian, to figure out what amount — if any — is right for you.\\n\\nFactors that affect your decision might be the extra calories alcohol brings to the diet, or any kidney or liver problems you may have. And if you just don\\\'t like the taste of alcohol, that\\\'s a good reason to stay away from it too.\\n\\nEating the Mediterranean way\\n\\nWant to try the Mediterranean diet? These tips will help you get started:\\n\\nEat more fruits and vegetables. Each day, aim for 2 to 3 servings of fruit and four or more servings of vegetables. One serving of fruit equals a medium piece of whole fruit or one cup of chopped. One serving of vegetables equals two cups of leafy produce, one cup of raw veggies, or half a cup of cooked vegetables.\\n\\nEach day, aim for 2 to 3 servings of fruit and four or more servings of vegetables. One serving of fruit equals a medium piece of whole fruit or one cup of chopped. One serving of vegetables equals two cups of leafy produce, one cup of raw veggies, or half a cup of cooked vegetables. Choose whole grains. Switch to whole-grain bread, cereal and pasta. You also can try other whole grains, such as bulgur, barley and farro. If you eat about 2,000 calories a day, aim to have at least 3 ounces of whole grains. You can get 1 ounce from a slice of bread, a cup of ready-made cereal, or half a cup of cooked rice or pasta. Read the Nutrition Facts label to find out how much of a product is in one serving.\\n\\nSwitch to whole-grain bread, cereal and pasta.

Answer: The best diet for general longevity is one that emphasizes a balanced and healthy eating pattern, such as the Mediterranean diet or the guidelines provided by the Healthy Eating Plate. Both of these approaches focus on consuming a variety of nutrient-rich foods, including:

1. **Fruits and Vegetables**: Making up a significant portion of the diet, these provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

2. **Whole Grains**: Such as whole wheat, barley, quinoa, and brown rice, which have a milder effect on blood sugar and insulin levels compared to refined grains.

3. **Healthy Proteins**: Including fish, poultry, beans, and nuts, while limiting red and processed meats.

4. **Healthy Fats**: Emphasizing unsaturated fats from sources like olive oil, nuts, and seeds, which can help lower the risk of heart disease.

5. **Moderate Dairy**: Choosing low-fat options and limiting high-fat dairy products.

6. **Limited Sugar and Red Meat**: Reducing the intake of foods with added sugars and red meat.

7. **Hydration**: Drinking water, coffee, or tea, and avoiding sugary drinks.

8. **Physical Activity**: Staying active is also an important component of a healthy lifestyle.

Both the Mediterranean diet and the Healthy Eating Plate encourage a plant-based approach, regular physical activity, and mindful eating, which have been associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases and improved overall health, contributing to longevity.

Answer: If a fabric for a bed sheet made from Tencel fiber is not treated with resin, it would likely maintain its natural properties. Tencel is known for being less wrinkly than cotton and fairly easy to care for, so it would still be relatively smooth and durable without resin treatment. However, the resin treatment specifically improves the smoothness appearance after repeated home laundering, so without it, the fabric might not achieve the same level of smoothness as resin-treated fabrics after multiple washes. Nonetheless, Tencel's inherent qualities would still make it a long-lasting and comfortable option for bed sheets.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Introduction

Organisms live within an, which is defined as an assemblage of populations of at least two different species that interact directly and indirectly within a defined geographic area (Agrawal2007; Ricklefs 2008; Brooker. 2009). Species interactions form the basis for manysuch as nutrient cycling and food webs. The nature of these interactions can vary depending on the evolutionary context and environmental conditions in which they occur. As a result, ecological interactions between individual organisms and entire species are often difficult to define and measure and are frequently dependent on the scale and context of the interactions (Harrison & Cornell 2008; Ricklefs 2008; Brooker2009). Nonetheless, there are several classes of interactions among organisms that are found throughout many habitats and ecosystems. Using these classes of interactions as a framework when studying an ecological community allows scientists to describe naturally occurring processes and aids in predicting how human alterations to the natural world may affect ecosystem properties and processes.At the coarsest level, ecological interactions can be defined as either intra-specific or inter-specific.are those that occur between individuals of the same species, while interactions that occur between two or more species are called. However, since most species occur within ecological communities, these interactions can be affected by, and indirectly influence, other species and their interactions. The ones that will be discussed in this article are. These are not the only types of species interactions, just the most studied — and they are all parts of a larger network of interactions that make up the complex relationships occurring in nature.

Competition

Competition is most typically considered the interaction of individuals that vie for a common resource that is in limited supply, but more generally can be defined as the direct or indirect interaction of organisms that leads to a change in fitness when the organisms share the same resource. The outcome usually has negative effects on the weaker competitors. There are three major forms of competition. Two of them, interference competition and exploitation competition, are categorized as real competition. A third form, apparent competition, is not. Interference competition occurs directly between individuals, while exploitation competition and apparent competition occur indirectly between individuals (Holomuzki et. al 2010) (Figure 1).

Diagrams illustrating the three major types of competitive interactions where the dashed lines indicate indirect interactions and the solid lines direct interactions that are part of ecological communities. C1 = Competitor #1, C2 = Competitor #2, P = Predator, R = Resource. © 2013 All rights reserved.

When an individual directly alters the resource-attaining behavior of other individuals, the interaction is considered interference competition. For example, when a male gorilla prohibits other males from accessing a mate by using physical aggression or displays of aggression, the dominant male is directly altering the mating behavior of other males. This is also an example of an intra-specific interaction. Exploitation competition occurs when individuals interact indirectly as they compete for common resources, like territory, prey or food. Simply put, the use of the resource by one individual will decrease the amount available for other individuals. Whether by interference or exploitation, over time a superior competitor can eliminate an inferior one from the area, resulting in competitive exclusion (Hardin 1960). The outcomes of competition between two species can be predicted using equations, and one of the most well known is the Lotka-Volterra model (Volterra 1926, Lotka 1932). This model relates the population density and carrying capacity of two species to each other and includes their overall effect on each other. The four outcomes of this model are: 1) species A competitively excludes species B; 2) species B competitively excludes species A; 3) either species wins based on population densities; or 4) coexistence occurs. Species can survive together if intra-specific is stronger than inter-specific competition. This means that each species will inhibit their own population growth before they inhibit that of the competitor, leading to coexistence.

Another mechanism for avoiding competitive exclusion is to adopt alternative life history and dispersal strategies, which are usually reinforced through natural selection. This mechanism reduces competitive interactions and increases opportunities for new colonization and nutrient acquisition. The success of this is often dependent upon events (such as tide, flood, or fire disturbances) that create opportunities for dispersal and nutrient acquisition. Consider that Plant Species A is more efficient than Plant Species B at nutrient uptake, but Plant B is a better disperser. In this example, the resource under competition is nutrients, but nutrient acquisition is related to availability. If a disturbance opens up new space for colonization, Plant B is expected to arrive first and maintain its presence in the community until Plant A arrives and begins competing with Plant B. Eventually Plant A will outcompete Plant B, perhaps by growing faster because Plant A is more efficient at nutrient acquisition. With an increasing Plant A population, the Plant B population will decline, and given enough time, can be excluded from that area. The exclusion of Plant B can be avoided if a local disturbance (for example, prairie fires) consistently opens new opportunities (space) for colonization. This often happens in nature, and thus disturbance can balance competitive interactions and prevent competitive exclusion by creating patches that will be readily colonized by species with better dispersal strategies (Roxburgh et al. 2004) (Figure 2). The success of the dispersal versus nutrient acquisition trade-off depends, however, on the frequency and spatial proximity (or how close they are) of disturbance events relative to the dispersal rates of individuals of the competing species. Coexistence can be achieved when disturbances occur at a frequency or distance that allows the weaker, but often better dispersing, competitor to be maintained in a habitat. If the disturbance is too frequent the inferior competitor (better disperser) wins, but if the disturbance is rare then the superior competitor slowly outcompetes the inferior competitor, resulting in competitive exclusion. This is known as the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Horn 1975, Connell 1978).

Apparent competition occurs when two individuals that do not directly compete for resources affect each other indirectly by being prey for the same predator (Hatcher et al. 2006). Consider a hawk (predator, see below) that preys both on squirrels and mice. In this relationship, if the squirrel population increases, then the mouse population may be positively affected since more squirrels will be available as prey for the hawks. However, an increased squirrel population may eventually lead to a higher population of hawks requiring more prey, thus, negatively affecting the mice through increased predation pressure as the squirrel population declines. The opposite effect could also occur through a decrease in food resources for the predator. If the squirrel population decreases, it can indirectly lead to a reduction in the mouse population since they will be the more abundant food source for the hawks. Apparent competition can be difficult to identify in nature, often because of the complexity of indirect interactions that involve multiple species and changing environmental conditions.

Predation and Herbivory

Predation requires one individual, the predator, to kill and eat another individual, the prey (Figure 3). In most examples of this relationship, the predator and prey are both animals; however, protozoans are known to prey on bacteria and other protozoans and some plants are known to trap and digest insects (for example, pitcher plant) (Figure 4). Typically, this interaction occurs between species (inter-specific); but when it occurs within a species (intra-specific) it is cannibalism. Cannibalism is actually quite common in both aquatic and terrestrial food webs (Huss et al. 2010; Greenwood et al. 2010). It often occurs when food resources are scarce, forcing organisms of the same species to feed on each other. Surprisingly, this can actually benefit the species (though not the prey) as a whole by sustaining the population through times of limited resources while simultaneously allowing the scarce resources to rebound through reduced feeding pressure (Huss et al. 2010). The predator-prey relationship can be complex through sophisticated adaptations by both predators and prey, in what has been called an "evolutionary arms race." Typical predatory adaptations are sharp teeth and claws, stingers or poison, quick and agile bodies, camouflage coloration and excellent olfactory, visual or aural acuity. Prey species have evolved a variety of defenses including behavioral, morphological, physiological, mechanical, life-history synchrony and chemical defenses to avoid being preyed upon (Aaron, Farnsworth et al. 1996, 2008).

Another interaction that is much like predation is herbivory, which is when an individual feeds on all or part of a photosynthetic organism (plant or algae), possibly killing it (Gurevitch et al. 2006). An important difference between herbivory and predation is that herbivory does not always lead to the death of the individual. Herbivory is often the foundation of food webs since it involves the consumption of primary producers (organisms that convert light energy to chemical energy through photosynthesis). Herbivores are classified based on the part of the plant consumed. Granivores eat seeds; grazers eat grasses and low shrubs; browsers eat leaves from trees or shrubs; and frugivores eat fruits. Plants, like prey, also have evolved adaptations to herbivory. Tolerance is the ability to minimize negative effects resulting from herbivory, while resistance means that plants use defenses to avoid being consumed. Physical (for example, thorns, tough material, sticky substances) and chemical adaptations (for example, irritating toxins on piercing structures, and bad-tasting chemicals in leaves) are two common types of plant defenses (Gurevitch et al. 2006) (Figure 5).

Symbiosis: Mutualism, Commensalism and Parasitism

Symbiosis is an interaction characterized by two or more species living purposefully in direct contact with each other. The term "symbiosis" includes a broad range of species interactions but typically refers to three major types: mutualism, commensalism and parasitism. Mutualism is a symbiotic interaction where both or all individuals benefit from the relationship. Mutualism can be considered obligate or facultative. (Be aware that sometimes the term "symbiosis" is used specifically to mean mutualism.) Species involved in obligate mutualism cannot survive without the relationship, while facultative mutualistic species can survive individually when separated but often not as well (Aaron et al. 1996). For example, leafcutter ants and certain fungi have an obligate mutualistic relationship. The ant larvae eat only one kind of fungi, and the fungi cannot survive without the constant care of the ants. As a result, the colonies activities revolve around cultivating the fungi. They provide it with digested leaf material, can sense if a leaf species is harmful to the fungi, and keep it free from pests (Figure 6). A good example of a facultative mutualistic relationship is found between mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots. It has been suggested that 80% of vascular plants form relationships with mycorrhizal fungi (Deacon 2006). Yet the relationship can turn parasitic when the environment of the fungi is nutrient rich, because the plant no longer provides a benefit (Johnson et al. 1997). Thus, the nature of the interactions between two species is often relative to the abiotic conditions and not always easily identified in nature.

Commensalism is an interaction in which one individual benefits while the other is neither helped nor harmed. For example, orchids (examples of epiphytes) found in tropical rainforests grow on the branches of trees in order to access light, but the presence of the orchids does not affect the trees (Figure 7). Commensalism can be difficult to identify because the individual that benefits may have indirect effects on the other individual that are not readily noticeable or detectable. If the orchid from the previous example grew too large and broke off the branch or shaded the tree, then the relationship would become parasitic.

Parasitism occurs when one individual, the parasite, benefits from another individual, the host, while harming the host in the process. Parasites feed on host tissue or fluids and can be found within (endoparasites) or outside (ectoparasites) of the host body (Holomuzki et al. 2010). For example, different species of ticks are common ectoparasites on animals and humans. Parasitism is a good example of how species interactions are integrated. Parasites typically do not kill their hosts, but can significantly weaken them; indirectly causing the host to die via illness, effects on metabolism, lower overall health and increased predation potential (Holomuzki et al. 2010). For instance, there is a trematode that parasitizes certain aquatic snails. Infected snails lose some of their characteristic behavior and will remain on the tops of rocks in streams where food is inadequate and even during peaks of waterfowl activity, making them easy prey for the birds (Levri 1999). Further, parasitism of prey species can indirectly alter the interactions of associated predators, other prey of the predators, and their own prey. When a parasite influences the competitive interaction between two species, it is termed parasite-mediated competition (Figure 8). The parasite can infect one or both of the involved species (Hatcher et al. 2006). For example, the malarial parasite Plasmodium azurophilum differentially infects two lizard species found in the Caribbean, Anolis gingivinius and Anolis wattsi. A. gingivinius is a better competitor than A. wattsi but is susceptible to P. azurophilum, while A. wattsi rarely contracts the parasite. These lizards are found coexisting only when the parasite is present, indicating that the parasite lowers the competitive ability of A. gingivinius' (Schall 1992). In this case, the parasite prevents competitive exclusion, therefore maintaining species diversity in this ecosystem.

Summary

The species interactions discussed above are only some of the known interactions that occur in nature and can be difficult to identify because they can directly or indirectly influence other intra-specific and inter-specific interactions. Additionally, the role of abiotic factors adds complexity to species interactions and how we understand them. That is to say, species interactions are part of the framework that forms the complexity of ecological communities. Species interactions are extremely important in shaping community dynamics. It was originally thought that competition was the driving force of community structure, but it is now understood that all of the interactions discussed in this article, along with their indirect effects and the variation of responses within and between species, define communities and ecosystems (Agrawal 2007).
General overview

Understanding the mechanisms that maintain species coexistence has long been one of the fundamental goals in plant community ecology (Adler et al. 2007; Chase and Myers 2011; Weiher et al. 2011; Tuomisto et al. 2012; Fukami 2015). A tendency to equate (or at least approximate) coexistence to biological diversity (Chesson 2000) makes such an understanding increasingly urgent in this era of rapid environmental change, where the productivity, diversity, and stability of many ecological system is being reduced (McCann 2000; Hooper et al. 2005; Tilman et al. 2006; Ives and Carpenter 2007; Mougi and Kondoh 2012).

Here, we are broadly concerned with patterns and mechanisms of plant species coexistence under very harsh environmental conditions in a coastal salt marsh system. Harsh conditions can drive coexistence-related processes, such as biological interactions (e.g., predation, competition, and facilitation), ecological succession, dispersal, speciation, and resource partitioning. In this time of rapid climate change, many ecosystems are experiencing profound alterations to ambient physical conditions, which can increase the influences of harshness on inhabiting organisms. An example is found in coastal areas where recent sea-level anomalies have led to the increased frequency, duration, and depth of submergence by saline water (Morris et al. 2002; FitzGerald et al. 2008; Nicholls and Cazenave 2010; Sallenger et al. 2012). Similar climatic effects include extended dry periods in arid environments (Holmgren et al. 2006; Seager et al. 2007; Jiménez et al. 2011) and increased fire activities in the western US forests (Westerling et al. 2011). We propose that it will become increasingly important to understand the mechanisms of species coexistence under highly stressful conditions in order to fully understand plant community structure and function, and to develop appropriate management strategies (Callaway et al. 2002; Kelly and Goulden 2008; Anderegg et al. 2013; Walter et al. 2013).

Numerous investigations have been conducted to enhance our knowledge of the patterns and mechanisms of species coexistence, in the contexts of biological interactions among different species and environmental stress gradients (Wright 2002; Silvertown 2004; Tokeshi 2009; Siepielski and McPeek 2010; Gravel et al. 2011; Cho et al. 2019; Jung et al. 2019). As a result, there are more than 100 denominated theories developed from various ecological systems (Palmer 1994). An exhaustive review of these ideas is not the aim of this paper. Rather, we focused on a few contending but related theories that are relevant to both harshness and the particular environmental setting of the study system (see “Study area” section). For example, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell 1978) may not be a robust model because we investigated a marsh system that is very stressful but experiences little influence from disturbance events. In addition, given the absence of significant herbivores at the marsh, theories associated with predation are not explicitly considered.

Theory I: coexistence maintained by niche differentiation

The most widely accepted theory on species coexistence in traditional plant ecology is based on a simple statement, only those species differing sufficiently in resource use can coexist, a corollary of which is, two (or more) species cannot coexist in the same niche (Gause 1934). This theory appears to be adopted by many scientists as a paradigm (e.g., Silvertown 2004; Mason et al. 2011; cf. Tilman 2004), rather than merely as a hypothesis. It is even considered “perhaps the only specific principle or law of nature ever to be proposed in ecology” (Vandermeer 1972: p. 110)The core of niche theory lies in the concept of competitive exclusion. In accordance with Darwin (1859) and Gause (1934), classic ecologists, such as Hutchinson (1959), May and MacArthur (1972), Pianka (1974), Whittaker (1977), and Diamond (1975), suggested that competition plays a major role in determining community structure and diversity by impeding species coexistence. In order to coexist in a same habitat, species should differ in their utilization of resources (e.g., nutrients, water, light), so that they avoid some critical level of interaction. This difference in resource demand has been termed character displacement (Brown and Wilson 1956; Hutchinson 1959), limiting similarity (MacArthur and Levins 1967; Abrams 1983), species packing (MacArthur 1972), or more often, niche differentiation (or diversification, separation, divergence; Connell 1978). If niche differentiation is not achieved, competitive exclusion will eventually hamper species coexistence. Three conditions are required to meet such a case (Aarssen 1989):

the demands of two species on resources sufficiently exceed the supply

the two species make demands on a sufficiently similar set of resource units

one of the species possesses a sufficiently greater competitive ability for these particular resource units.

Theory II: coexistence without niche differentiation

In the 1970s, some ecologists began to doubt the validity of the niche-based idea, that is, the concepts of competitive exclusion and niche differentiation. This new view was prompted by two factors. First, there was serious lack of empirical evidence that articulated whether coexistence was truly maintained only by niche differentiation, and whether competitive exclusion (and also reduced coexistence) was inevitable if niche differentiation was not sufficient (Wiens 1977; Mahdi et al. 1989; Holyoak and Loreau 2006; Leibold and McPeek 2006; Clark 2009). Specifically, few studies have provided clear-cut data showing that the degree of niche separation is compatible with the observed number of species (but see Russell et al. 1985).

Second, the coexistence of plant species in a certain habitat might be considered not in the context of niche differentiation but, paradoxically, niche overlap (i.e., coincident utilization of one or more resources by two or more species, sharing resources). Higher plants are generally immobile, and thus lack any real choice in resources. By and large, they make demands on virtually the same resources, such as light, nutrients, and water. Therefore, one can justifiably assume that there could be significant overlapping of niches among the coexisting species in many plant communities. If a group of species occur together, it is very likely that they are ecologically and functionally similar (i.e., niches overlap) because, otherwise, they would not have adapted to the habitat and coexisted in the first place. These similarities imply comparable morphology, height, expected life time, and rate of seed production, which in turn would result in similar abilities among the coexisting species to compete for resources (Ågren et al. 1984). This view of retarded competitive exclusion and continued species coexistence due to similar competitiveness has long been conceptualized as competitive combining ability (Aarssen 1983, 1989, 1992) and balanced competition (Zobel 1992).

Aarssen (1983, 1984) tried to put this issue into an evolutionary perspective. Basically, he argued that natural selection processes enhance relative competitive ability rather than niche differentiation, thereby maintaining a balance of competitive abilities for contested resources among species. By this logic, individuals of a superior species, instead of outcompeting those of an inferior counterpart, suppress themselves through intra-specific competition. In the meantime, the weaker competitors increase their fitness, which eventually leads to a reduced difference in the relative competitive abilities between the two species (see also Stoll and Prati 2001; Vellend 2006; Fridley et al. 2007; Whitlock et al. 2007; Silvertown et al. 2009). Below is a part of Aarssen’s (1983, p. 725) conclusion:

All biological attributes of a species will play a part in determining its niche requirements…, and its relative competitive ability for those requirements…niche requirements generally overlap broadly in plants,…coexistence is permitted because there are numerous possible permutations and combinations of biological attributes in plants which are roughly equivalent in the overall competitive power…these attribute complexes are continually adjusted in an ongoing process of coevolution in which local neighborhoods are constantly engaged in a fine-tuning process…Consequently, natural selection ultimately maintains a balance of overall relative competitive abilities between two species for essentially the same contested resources.

Species’ engagement in the fine-tuning process (i.e., localized competition sensu Shmida and Ellner 1984) implies that they do not necessarily avoid competition to avoid competitive exclusion. Similar doubts about the robustness and general applicability of niche differentiation and competitive exclusion were also raised by Grubb (1977); regeneration niche), Shmida and Ellner (1984); stable coexistence of trophically equivalent species), and Hubbell (2001); unified neutral theory of biodiversity). In particular, Hubbell’s (2001) neutral theory assumes all species to be demographically and ecologically identical. Hence, the structure of community assembly arises mainly from neutral stochastic processes, such as dispersal, chance colonization, random extinction, ecological drift, and priority effects (Bell 2000; Holyoak and Loreau 2006; McGill et al. 2006; Mutshinda and O’Hara 2011). Aarssen and Hubbell have long agreed that their theories amount to essentially the same thing in terms of accounting for why species are able to coexist (Aarssen personal communication via e-mail April 5, 2019).

Theory III: coexistence along environmental stress gradients

Environmental stress models (e.g., Menge and Sutherland 1987; Bruno et al. 2003; Scrosati and Heaven 2007) recognize that the level of physical stress significantly affects the behavior of individual species, modes of biological interactions, and eventually, patterns of species coexistence and diversity in a plant community. One traditional belief in this regard has been that competition should be more intense in the benign and productive side of an environmental gradient, whereas the intensity decreases toward harsh conditions (i.e., stress gradient hypothesis; Bertness and Callaway 1994; Maestre et al. 2009; Holmgren and Scheffer 2010; Lee et al. 2018a, 2018b). In the former case, a (few) strong competitor(s) will outcompete inferior ones, thereby resulting in low-level diversity. In the latter, very high stresses allow only highly tolerant species to survive (i.e., reduction of species pool), and thus, species diversity is expected to be low. Intermediate-level harshness is predicted to compromise these two extreme situations and maximize biodiversity because a certain level of stresses prevents a superior competitor from monopolizing available resources, and such stresses secure space for stable populations of inferior species. In sum, retarded competitive exclusion because of physical harshness has been considered a major factor contributing to the maintenance of species coexistence (Grime 2001; Hart and Marshall 2013). Indeed, this notion provides the basis for influential classical theories of non-equilibrium coexistence, such as patch dynamics (Pickett 1980), the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell 1978), and Huston’s (1979) dynamic equilibrium model.

There are at least two theories associated with niche differentiation, indicating that one can observe high biodiversity even under highly stressful conditions. First, Tilman’s (1985) resource-ratio hypothesis suggests that high-level species coexistence can be achieved at low resource levels because the coexisting plants experience their environment as inherently spatially variable more than at high levels of resources. In a somewhat different context, Chesson and Huntly (1997) propose that stable coexistence may result easily from classical resource partitioning when strong environmental harshness makes existing tolerant species more equal in demographic rates. They conclude that, although harshness itself cannot stabilize species coexistence, it may facilitate or broaden the effects of other diversity-stabilizing mechanisms, such as resource partitioning and niche differentiation. In addition, facilitative biological interactions can be another important mechanism of species coexistence under environmental harshness (He and Berness 2014), as has been demonstrated in salt marshes (Bertness and Shumway 1993), arid ecosystems (Maestre and Cortina 2004), and alpine ecosystems (Callaway et al. 2002).

Theory IV: coexistence under non-equilibrium versus equilibrium conditions

Most of the environmental stress models discussed above exhibit one common characteristic that an important (and often imperative) component is the role of disturbance in shaping community structure and patterns of species diversity. Such a strong emphasis on disturbance implies that species coexistence is maintained under non-equilibrium states, in which disturbance events are frequent and strong enough to prevent a system from returning to its previous ecological phase before another disturbance event occurs (Connell 1978; Chesson 2000; Araújo and Pearson 2005). Consequently, a question arises concerning the general applicability of current theories of coexistence to communities that exhibit stressful conditions but limited and infrequent disturbances, that is, communities where a degree of equilibrium might be attained.

Many theorists have been optimistic that disturbance-related models will be applicable to many different types of communities (but see Fox 2013). However, for example, Locke’s (1992) classic analyses of zooplankton communities along pH gradients (i.e., acidification stress) did not support such an expectation. She argued that it is questionable whether the level of physical disturbance included in the conventional models is comparable to the actual level of stresses that plant species perceive and respond to (see also reviews by Mackey and Currie 2001; Hughes et al. 2007). In short, the traditional disturbance-based models may not be robust if species in a system experience non-lethal environmental harshness.

Theory V: modern perspectives

Although the validity of niche theory has been recognized in community ecology, it also has limitations. First, it is suggested that the niche itself is an abstract concept (Chase and Leibold 2003; Araújo and Guisan 2006; Soberón and Nakamura 2009). Ambiguities in the original formulation of fundamental and realized niche concepts often result in conflicting interpretations as to what is truly a niche in the ecological system (Araújo and Guisan 2006). Furthermore, niche theory assumes the existence of stable conditions in, for example, required resources for species, but whether such conditions actually exist or are readily detectable in reality remains elusive (Torres 1984).

Neutral theory has also faced several criticisms, arising mainly from its assumption that species are functionally equivalent and thus all individual species within a community have the same chances of reproduction and mortality regardless of their characteristics (Theory II: coexistence without niche differentiation). In real-world communities, many species exhibit large differences in traits. Therefore, if neutrality holds, these differences should be prone to fitness-equalizing tradeoffs, which is extremely unlikely (Purves and Turnbull 2010). In addition, as Hubbell (2001) acknowledged, stochastic processes associated with neutral theory do not predict coexistence patterns well at local spatial scales (Jabot and Chave 2011; Pos et al. 2019). Related to this is the question of whether perceived neutral processes might result from non-neutral mechanisms (Alonso et al. 2006). This is because neutral theory aggregates and averages the information on community assembly processes across sites, and this will blur deterministic mechanisms, making them appear as neutral dynamics (Clark 2012). However, in the last two decades, the neutral theory perspective has often been used to explain community assembly especially at regional scales (Chave 2004; Rosindell et al. 2011, 2012; Black and McKane 2012; Chesson 2013; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; D’Andrea and Ostling 2016). In addition, due to its simplicity and tractability, the theory still serves as a useful null hypothesis for complex biodiversity patterns (Rosindell et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Munoz and Huneman 2016).

Despite its drawbacks in assumption, prediction, and measurement (Pocheville 2015), niche theory has also advanced in the new millennium (Adler et al. 2007; HilleRisLambers et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Munoz and Huneman 2016; Letten et al. 2017; Barabás et al. 2018). Ambiguous definitions of niches have been redefined through quantitative approaches of modern coexistence theory (Chesson 2000; Letten et al. 2017). Modern coexistence theory is based on the Lotka–Volterra model and examines community structure in relation to the influence of environmental factors on species interactions (Chesson 2000, 2013; Adler et al. 2007; Ellner et al. 2019). In a theory-based model, complex interactions between species in a community are simplified into competition coefficients, which reflect intra- and inter-specific effects on per capita growth rate (Letten et al. 2017). Under modern coexistence theory, niche and fitness differences are controlling factors that allow species to coexist in the same community. The niche difference is part of a stabilizing mechanism that differentiates niches among species within a community to decrease competition and thus optimize the chance of survival. On the contrary, the equalizing mechanism balances fitness differences between species, thereby contributing to species coexistence (HilleRisLambers et al. 2012). The stabilizing niche differences can be reduced as the average fitness differences decrease. In other words, when niche differences are larger than relative fitness differences, species in a community can stably coexist (Chesson 2000).

Contemporary niche theory is developed from the consumer–resource model (Tilman 1982) and provides an explicit basis for coexistence (Chase and Leibold 2003). While Tilman’s model focuses on the dynamics of the consumer–resource system, Chase and Leibold (2003) expand the range of this model from interactions between biotic factors to interactions between biotic and abiotic factors (Letten et al. 2017). A major difference between modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory lies in the ways they define niche. For modern coexistence theory, boundaries of niches are defined through an interaction between two or more species. Under contemporary niche theory, in contrast, niches indicate particular traits of an individual species, and the niches of multiple species within a community can sometimes overlap.

In recent years, there has been a growing body of researchers trying to integrate the niche and neutral perspectives (Adler et al. 2007; Chisholm and Pacala 2010; Pigolotti and Cencini 2013; Kalyuzhny et al. 2015). In particular, a number of studies have demonstrated theoretically and empirically that both niche-based stabilizing mechanisms and neutral-based equalizing mechanisms appear to operate simultaneously along the continuum of environmental stress gradients in many ecological systems (Gravel et al. 2006; Mutshinda and O’Hara 2011; Jeraldo et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Scheffer et al. 2018; Ellner et al. 2019; Kim 2019). Accordingly, the focus today is increasingly on understanding the relative importance of these two mechanisms for species composition and diversity under different environmental conditions (Smith and Lundholm 2010; Chase and Myers 2011; Tuomisto et al. 2012). In particular, it is recently proposed that deterministic processes gain importance and stochastic processes lose importance as a community enters a regime of more stressful conditions (e.g., Chase 2007, 2010; Guo et al. 2014; cf. Lepori and Malmqvist 2009). That is, if a system is under harshness, only a small subset of the regional species pool can pass through the associated environmental filters. Because the resulting species richness is low, the probability of ecological drift will reduce, leading to a community likely assembled by niche-driven processes (i.e., weak stochasticity) (Kim 2019).

Summary

This review of the major coexistence theories provides four insights. First, there are few general models that can be applied to many ecological systems with convincing results. Even the widely accepted niche differentiation hypothesis has faced strongly opposing viewpoints (especially from the competitive combining ability hypothesis) over decades. The contrasting theories of niche differentiation and competitive combining ability (or neutrality) are the key interests of this present work. Second, the lack of general models implies that ecologists are still far from understanding the mechanisms of species coexistence under harsh environmental conditions. Much remains to be discovered (e.g., coexistence by or without niche differentiation), beyond the hypothesis that the intensity of competitive interactions weakens near the stressful end of physical gradients. Third, due to the conventional emphasis on disturbance, stressful systems with non-lethal conditions have not received the attention they deserve. The ecology of such systems will be increasingly important as global climate change extends the period of chronic stresses that are not necessarily fatal to inhabiting plants. Finally, for decades, theories have been presented, but further empirical insights are required based on field data to test the various coexistence models at different spatial scales and in different ecosystems. We do not claim that our current research resolves these four issues. Rather, this paper provides a set of observational species composition data from a single marsh system, in which plant communities experience non-lethal stresses along an environmental gradient; it should be considered a springboard for more extensive experimental research in various ecological systems.

Hypothesis

In this research, we address a fundamental question, what are the patterns and possible mechanisms of plant species coexistence under very harsh but non-lethal environmental conditions? To rephrase, the community to be tested is not directly influenced by high-magnitude disturbing forces but shows a certain level of “well-defined, autogenic developmental trends” (Odum 1985). We broadly hypothesize that there will be an overall trend in species diversity along environmental stress gradients at the study marsh. In particular, following the general explanations of the environmental stress models explained above (Theory III: coexistence along environmental stress gradients), we expect that the highest diversity will be observed at the intermediate-level stresses along the environmental gradient we examine. However, this hypothesis might be rejected if, for example, we observe unexpectedly high species diversity even under very stressful conditions.

Pianka (1974), in his classic niche overlap hypothesis, predicted that the maximum tolerable niche overlap between two species should be an inverse function of the intensity of inter-specific competition. Therefore, both decreasing overlap (i.e., niche differentiation) and increasing species diversity will indicate highly intense diffuse competition (i.e., native species in a community compete among themselves). A corollary of this idea is that high-level species diversity implies high-level diffuse competition (MacArthur 1972), which in turn significantly lowers niche overlap (see also Russell et al. 1985; Silvertown 2004). We embody these ideas as a conceptual model along a resource gradient at different levels of species diversity (Fig. 1). In the model, we hypothesize that high diversity is maintained by niche differentiation and is associated with intense diffuse competition. In the case of low diversity, reduced competition allows niche overlap (i.e., resource sharing) to increase. Assuming that the three systems with different levels of species diversity in the model possess the same extent of resource niches, we expect that niche breadth should be high where diversity is low and low where diversity is high. Niche breadth is a measure of the evenness of resource utilization by species along given niche dimensions (Levins 1968). High and low niche breadths (i.e., high and low evenness) are, therefore, indicative of generalist and specialist species, respectively (Vandermeer 1972; Gravel et al. 2006; Finke and Snyder 2008).
Answer: Competition plays a significant role in shaping community structure and species coexistence. It is one of the fundamental interactions that influence the dynamics of ecological communities. The traditional view, as outlined in niche theory, suggests that competition is a major force that determines community structure by impeding species coexistence unless niche differentiation occurs. This means that species must differ in their resource use to coexist, avoiding competitive exclusion.

However, the role of competition is complex and can vary depending on environmental conditions and the presence of other interactions. For instance, under harsh environmental conditions, the intensity of competition may decrease, allowing for coexistence through mechanisms other than niche differentiation. This is supported by the stress gradient hypothesis, which suggests that competition is more intense in benign environments and less so in harsh conditions.

Moreover, modern perspectives on coexistence integrate both niche and neutral theories, recognizing that both niche-based stabilizing mechanisms and neutral-based equalizing mechanisms can operate simultaneously. This suggests that while competition is important, it is not the sole factor determining community structure. Other interactions, such as facilitation and environmental stress, also play crucial roles.

In summary, competition is a key factor in shaping community structure and species coexistence, but its influence is modulated by other ecological interactions and environmental conditions. Understanding the balance between competition and other factors is essential for predicting community dynamics, especially in the context of rapid environmental changes.

Species interactions form the basis for manysuch as nutrient cycling and food webs. The nature of these interactions can vary depending on the evolutionary context and environmental conditions in which they occur. As a result, ecological interactions between individual organisms and entire species are often difficult to define and measure and are frequently dependent on the scale and context of the interactions (Harrison & Cornell 2008; Ricklefs 2008; Brooker2009). Nonetheless, there are several classes of interactions among organisms that are found throughout many habitats and ecosystems. Using these classes of interactions as a framework when studying an ecological community allows scientists to describe naturally occurring processes and aids in predicting how human alterations to the natural world may affect ecosystem properties and processes.At the coarsest level, ecological interactions can be defined as either intra-specific or inter-specific.are those that occur between individuals of the same species, while interactions that occur between two or more species are called. However, since most species occur within ecological communities, these interactions can be affected by, and indirectly influence, other species and their interactions. The ones that will be discussed in this article are. These are not the only types of species interactions, just the most studied — and they are all parts of a larger network of interactions that make up the complex relationships occurring in nature.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nCompetition is most typically considered the interaction of individuals that vie for a common resource that is in limited supply, but more generally can be defined as the direct or indirect interaction of organisms that leads to a change in fitness when the organisms share the same resource. The outcome usually has negative effects on the weaker competitors. There are three major forms of competition. Two of them, interference competition and exploitation competition, are categorized as real competition. A third form, apparent competition, is not. Interference competition occurs directly between individuals, while exploitation competition and apparent competition occur indirectly between individuals (Holomuzki et. al 2010) (Figure 1).\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: The three major types of competitive interactions. Diagrams illustrating the three major types of competitive interactions where the dashed lines indicate indirect interactions and the solid lines direct interactions that are part of ecological communities.

For example, when a male gorilla prohibits other males from accessing a mate by using physical aggression or displays of aggression, the dominant male is directly altering the mating behavior of other males. This is also an example of an intra-specific interaction. Exploitation competition occurs when individuals interact indirectly as they compete for common resources, like territory, prey or food. Simply put, the use of the resource by one individual will decrease the amount available for other individuals. Whether by interference or exploitation, over time a superior competitor can eliminate an inferior one from the area, resulting in competitive exclusion (Hardin 1960). The outcomes of competition between two species can be predicted using equations, and one of the most well known is the Lotka-Volterra model (Volterra 1926, Lotka 1932). This model relates the population density and carrying capacity of two species to each other and includes their overall effect on each other. The four outcomes of this model are: 1) species A competitively excludes species B; 2) species B competitively excludes species A; 3) either species wins based on population densities; or 4) coexistence occurs. Species can survive together if intra-specific is stronger than inter-specific competition. This means that each species will inhibit their own population growth before they inhibit that of the competitor, leading to coexistence.\\n\\nAnother mechanism for avoiding competitive exclusion is to adopt alternative life history and dispersal strategies, which are usually reinforced through natural selection. This mechanism reduces competitive interactions and increases opportunities for new colonization and nutrient acquisition. The success of this is often dependent upon events (such as tide, flood, or fire disturbances) that create opportunities for dispersal and nutrient acquisition. Consider that Plant Species A is more efficient than Plant Species B at nutrient uptake, but Plant B is a better disperser. In this example, the resource under competition is nutrients, but nutrient acquisition is related to availability. If a disturbance opens up new space for colonization, Plant B is expected to arrive first and maintain its presence in the community until Plant A arrives and begins competing with Plant B. Eventually Plant A will outcompete Plant B, perhaps by growing faster because Plant A is more efficient at nutrient acquisition. With an increasing Plant A population, the Plant B population will decline, and given enough time, can be excluded from that area. The exclusion of Plant B can be avoided if a local disturbance (for example, prairie fires) consistently opens new opportunities (space) for colonization. This often happens in nature, and thus disturbance can balance competitive interactions and prevent competitive exclusion by creating patches that will be readily colonized by species with better dispersal strategies (Roxburgh et al. 2004) (Figure 2). The success of the dispersal versus nutrient acquisition trade-off depends, however, on the frequency and spatial proximity (or how close they are) of disturbance events relative to the dispersal rates of individuals of the competing species. Coexistence can be achieved when disturbances occur at a frequency or distance that allows the weaker, but often better dispersing, competitor to be maintained in a habitat. If the disturbance is too frequent the inferior competitor (better disperser) wins, but if the disturbance is rare then the superior competitor slowly outcompetes the inferior competitor, resulting in competitive exclusion. This is known as the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Horn 1975, Connell 1978).\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: The results of simulation models on the role disturbances play in maintaining species coexistence between patches over time.

Consider a hawk (predator, see below) that preys both on squirrels and mice. In this relationship, if the squirrel population increases, then the mouse population may be positively affected since more squirrels will be available as prey for the hawks. However, an increased squirrel population may eventually lead to a higher population of hawks requiring more prey, thus, negatively affecting the mice through increased predation pressure as the squirrel population declines. The opposite effect could also occur through a decrease in food resources for the predator. If the squirrel population decreases, it can indirectly lead to a reduction in the mouse population since they will be the more abundant food source for the hawks. Apparent competition can be difficult to identify in nature, often because of the complexity of indirect interactions that involve multiple species and changing environmental conditions.\\n\\nPredation and Herbivory\\n\\nPredation requires one individual, the predator, to kill and eat another individual, the prey (Figure 3). In most examples of this relationship, the predator and prey are both animals; however, protozoans are known to prey on bacteria and other protozoans and some plants are known to trap and digest insects (for example, pitcher plant) (Figure 4). Typically, this interaction occurs between species (inter-specific); but when it occurs within a species (intra-specific) it is cannibalism. Cannibalism is actually quite common in both aquatic and terrestrial food webs (Huss et al. 2010; Greenwood et al. 2010). It often occurs when food resources are scarce, forcing organisms of the same species to feed on each other. Surprisingly, this can actually benefit the species (though not the prey) as a whole by sustaining the population through times of limited resources while simultaneously allowing the scarce resources to rebound through reduced feeding pressure (Huss et al. 2010). The predator-prey relationship can be complex through sophisticated adaptations by both predators and prey, in what has been called an "evolutionary arms race." Typical predatory adaptations are sharp teeth and claws, stingers or poison, quick and agile bodies, camouflage coloration and excellent olfactory, visual or aural acuity.

One traditional belief in this regard has been that competition should be more intense in the benign and productive side of an environmental gradient, whereas the intensity decreases toward harsh conditions (i.e., stress gradient hypothesis; Bertness and Callaway 1994; Maestre et al. 2009; Holmgren and Scheffer 2010; Lee et al. 2018a, 2018b). In the former case, a (few) strong competitor(s) will outcompete inferior ones, thereby resulting in low-level diversity. In the latter, very high stresses allow only highly tolerant species to survive (i.e., reduction of species pool), and thus, species diversity is expected to be low. Intermediate-level harshness is predicted to compromise these two extreme situations and maximize biodiversity because a certain level of stresses prevents a superior competitor from monopolizing available resources, and such stresses secure space for stable populations of inferior species. In sum, retarded competitive exclusion because of physical harshness has been considered a major factor contributing to the maintenance of species coexistence (Grime 2001; Hart and Marshall 2013). Indeed, this notion provides the basis for influential classical theories of non-equilibrium coexistence, such as patch dynamics (Pickett 1980), the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell 1978), and Huston’s (1979) dynamic equilibrium model.\\n\\nThere are at least two theories associated with niche differentiation, indicating that one can observe high biodiversity even under highly stressful conditions. First, Tilman’s (1985) resource-ratio hypothesis suggests that high-level species coexistence can be achieved at low resource levels because the coexisting plants experience their environment as inherently spatially variable more than at high levels of resources. In a somewhat different context, Chesson and Huntly (1997) propose that stable coexistence may result easily from classical resource partitioning when strong environmental harshness makes existing tolerant species more equal in demographic rates. They conclude that, although harshness itself cannot stabilize species coexistence, it may facilitate or broaden the effects of other diversity-stabilizing mechanisms, such as resource partitioning and niche differentiation. In addition, facilitative biological interactions can be another important mechanism of species coexistence under environmental harshness (He and Berness 2014), as has been demonstrated in salt marshes (Bertness and Shumway 1993), arid ecosystems (Maestre and Cortina 2004), and alpine ecosystems (Callaway et al. 2002).\\n\\nTheory IV: coexistence under non-equilibrium versus equilibrium conditions\\n\\nMost of the environmental stress models discussed above exhibit one common characteristic that an important (and often imperative) component is the role of disturbance in shaping community structure and patterns of species diversity. Such a strong emphasis on disturbance implies that species coexistence is maintained under non-equilibrium states, in which disturbance events are frequent and strong enough to prevent a system from returning to its previous ecological phase before another disturbance event occurs (Connell 1978; Chesson 2000; Araújo and Pearson 2005). Consequently, a question arises concerning the general applicability of current theories of coexistence to communities that exhibit stressful conditions but limited and infrequent disturbances, that is, communities where a degree of equilibrium might be attained.\\n\\nMany theorists have been optimistic that disturbance-related models will be applicable to many different types of communities (but see Fox 2013). However, for example, Locke’s (1992) classic analyses of zooplankton communities along pH gradients (i.e., acidification stress) did not support such an expectation. She argued that it is questionable whether the level of physical disturbance included in the conventional models is comparable to the actual level of stresses that plant species perceive and respond to (see also reviews by Mackey and Currie 2001; Hughes et al. 2007). In short, the traditional disturbance-based models may not be robust if species in a system experience non-lethal environmental harshness.\\n\\nTheory V: modern perspectives\\n\\nAlthough the validity of niche theory has been recognized in community ecology, it also has limitations. First, it is suggested that the niche itself is an abstract concept (Chase and Leibold 2003; Araújo and Guisan 2006; Soberón and Nakamura 2009). Ambiguities in the original formulation of fundamental and realized niche concepts often result in conflicting interpretations as to what is truly a niche in the ecological system (Araújo and Guisan 2006). Furthermore, niche theory assumes the existence of stable conditions in, for example, required resources for species, but whether such conditions actually exist or are readily detectable in reality remains elusive (Torres 1984).\\n\\nNeutral theory has also faced several criticisms, arising mainly from its assumption that species are functionally equivalent and thus all individual species within a community have the same chances of reproduction and mortality regardless of their characteristics (Theory II: coexistence without niche differentiation). In real-world communities, many species exhibit large differences in traits. Therefore, if neutrality holds, these differences should be prone to fitness-equalizing tradeoffs, which is extremely unlikely (Purves and Turnbull 2010). In addition, as Hubbell (2001) acknowledged, stochastic processes associated with neutral theory do not predict coexistence patterns well at local spatial scales (Jabot and Chave 2011; Pos et al. 2019). Related to this is the question of whether perceived neutral processes might result from non-neutral mechanisms (Alonso et al. 2006). This is because neutral theory aggregates and averages the information on community assembly processes across sites, and this will blur deterministic mechanisms, making them appear as neutral dynamics (Clark 2012). However, in the last two decades, the neutral theory perspective has often been used to explain community assembly especially at regional scales (Chave 2004; Rosindell et al. 2011, 2012; Black and McKane 2012; Chesson 2013; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; D’Andrea and Ostling 2016). In addition, due to its simplicity and tractability, the theory still serves as a useful null hypothesis for complex biodiversity patterns (Rosindell et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Munoz and Huneman 2016).\\n\\nDespite its drawbacks in assumption, prediction, and measurement (Pocheville 2015), niche theory has also advanced in the new millennium (Adler et al. 2007; HilleRisLambers et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Munoz and Huneman 2016; Letten et al. 2017; Barabás et al. 2018). Ambiguous definitions of niches have been redefined through quantitative approaches of modern coexistence theory (Chesson 2000; Letten et al. 2017). Modern coexistence theory is based on the Lotka–Volterra model and examines community structure in relation to the influence of environmental factors on species interactions (Chesson 2000, 2013; Adler et al. 2007; Ellner et al. 2019). In a theory-based model, complex interactions between species in a community are simplified into competition coefficients, which reflect intra- and inter-specific effects on per capita growth rate (Letten et al. 2017). Under modern coexistence theory, niche and fitness differences are controlling factors that allow species to coexist in the same community. The niche difference is part of a stabilizing mechanism that differentiates niches among species within a community to decrease competition and thus optimize the chance of survival. On the contrary, the equalizing mechanism balances fitness differences between species, thereby contributing to species coexistence (HilleRisLambers et al. 2012). The stabilizing niche differences can be reduced as the average fitness differences decrease. In other words, when niche differences are larger than relative fitness differences, species in a community can stably coexist (Chesson 2000).\\n\\nContemporary niche theory is developed from the consumer–resource model (Tilman 1982) and provides an explicit basis for coexistence (Chase and Leibold 2003). While Tilman’s model focuses on the dynamics of the consumer–resource system, Chase and Leibold (2003) expand the range of this model from interactions between biotic factors to interactions between biotic and abiotic factors (Letten et al. 2017). A major difference between modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory lies in the ways they define niche. For modern coexistence theory, boundaries of niches are defined through an interaction between two or more species. Under contemporary niche theory, in contrast, niches indicate particular traits of an individual species, and the niches of multiple species within a community can sometimes overlap.\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been a growing body of researchers trying to integrate the niche and neutral perspectives (Adler et al. 2007; Chisholm and Pacala 2010; Pigolotti and Cencini 2013; Kalyuzhny et al. 2015). In particular, a number of studies have demonstrated theoretically and empirically that both niche-based stabilizing mechanisms and neutral-based equalizing mechanisms appear to operate simultaneously along the continuum of environmental stress gradients in many ecological systems (Gravel et al. 2006; Mutshinda and O’Hara 2011; Jeraldo et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Scheffer et al. 2018; Ellner et al. 2019; Kim 2019). Accordingly, the focus today is increasingly on understanding the relative importance of these two mechanisms for species composition and diversity under different environmental conditions (Smith and Lundholm 20', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.8525898456573486, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:861'})]
Answer: Competition plays a significant role in shaping community structure and species coexistence. It influences the behavior of individual species and the modes of biological interactions, ultimately affecting patterns of species coexistence and diversity within a community. The intensity of competition can vary along environmental gradients, with more intense competition expected in benign and productive environments, leading to low diversity as strong competitors outcompete weaker ones. Conversely, in harsh conditions, only highly tolerant species survive, also resulting in low diversity. However, intermediate levels of environmental harshness can maximize biodiversity by preventing superior competitors from monopolizing resources, thus allowing stable populations of inferior species to coexist. This concept is supported by theories such as the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which suggests that disturbances can prevent competitive exclusion and maintain species coexistence. Additionally, niche differentiation and resource partitioning can facilitate coexistence even under stressful conditions. Overall, competition, along with other factors like environmental stress and disturbance, plays a crucial role in determining community structure and species diversity.

Answer: The discrepancy in activity between cell cultures (in vitro) and in vivo evaluations could be due to several factors. One potential cause is the difference in the complexity of the environments. In vitro conditions are controlled and simplified, whereas in vivo conditions involve complex interactions with the immune system, metabolism, and other physiological processes that can affect the protein's activity.

To enhance the protein's activity in vivo, one approach could be to inhibit autophagy, as suggested by the study on azithromycin. Inhibiting autophagy via up-regulation of p62 and LC-3B can increase the levels of death receptors DR4/5, which enhances the antitumor activity. This strategy could potentially be applied to your protein to improve its efficacy in vivo. Further studies would be needed to explore this approach and determine the best way to implement it for your specific protein.

Answer: The discrepancy in activity between cell cultures and in vivo evaluations could be due to several factors. In cell cultures, the environment is controlled and lacks the complexity of a living organism, which includes factors like immune response, metabolism, and tissue distribution that can affect the protein's activity. Additionally, the protein might be unstable or rapidly degraded in the in vivo environment, or it might not reach the target site in sufficient concentrations.

To enhance its activity in vivo, you could consider the following strategies:

1. **Stability Improvement**: Modify the protein to increase its stability in the bloodstream, possibly through site-directed mutagenesis to enhance its resistance to degradation.

2. **Targeting and Delivery**: Use targeted delivery systems, such as nanoparticles or conjugation with antibodies, to ensure the protein reaches the desired site of action in the body.

3. **Pharmacokinetics Optimization**: Alter the protein to improve its pharmacokinetic properties, such as increasing its half-life or reducing its clearance rate.

4. **Immune Evasion**: Modify the protein to reduce immunogenicity, ensuring it is not rapidly cleared by the immune system.

5. **Combination Therapy**: Use the protein in combination with other treatments that might enhance its efficacy or help it overcome biological barriers in vivo.

These strategies could help bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo efficacy, leading to better therapeutic outcomes.

Answer: The increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in business brings several ethical implications, including:

1. **Bias and Discrimination**: AI systems can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases if they are trained on biased data. This can lead to unfair treatment of individuals based on race, gender, or other characteristics.

2. **Privacy Concerns**: AI technologies often require large amounts of data, which can lead to concerns about data privacy and the potential misuse of personal information.

3. **Accountability and Transparency**: It can be challenging to determine who is responsible for decisions made by AI systems, especially when these systems operate with a level of autonomy. Ensuring transparency in how AI systems make decisions is crucial.

4. **Job Displacement**: As AI systems take over tasks traditionally performed by humans, there is a risk of job displacement, which can have significant social and economic impacts.

5. **Security Risks**: AI systems can be vulnerable to hacking and other security threats, which can have serious consequences, especially in critical industries like finance and healthcare.

6. **Moral and Ethical Decision-Making**: AI systems may be involved in making decisions that have moral or ethical implications, raising questions about how these systems should be programmed to handle such situations.

GraphRAG Score: 26Question: What are the top three industry standards for hydrographic surveying when it comes to sidescan sonar?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Side-scan sonar is well accepted as a tool for detection and visualisation of underwater objects and is widely used in support of safety of navigation surveys. Although side-scan sonars produce excellent images, these images are often difficult and time-consuming to review and analyse. These images typically contain spurious features and artefacts due to acoustic phenomena, such as refraction, and bottom characteristics, such as sand waves that result in a large number of false contacts. This article describes a research and development effort at Science Applications International Corporation to develop and apply advanced processing techniques in bottom target detection and image classification to support the automation of side-scan sonar data processing.

Shallow-water hydrographic surveys typically involve the collection of concurrent bathymetric and side-scan sonar data. Recent developments in bathymetric data processing within the hydrographic community have allowed for a decrease in the labour effort to process data while at the same time providing potentially superior data products. Over the past several years, the Acoustic and Marine Systems Operation within Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) has been involved in an internal research and development project to reduce the labour required to process the other sonar data type side-scan sonar.



The Marine Science and Technology Division of SAIC, located in Newport (RI, USA), performs a wide range of marine survey operations, with hydrographic surveys representing a major component of these. Most hydrographic surveys that SAIC has performed since 1994 (when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] first contracted out hydrographic surveys to private industry) have required 200% side-scan coverage, with resulting multi-beam bathymetry coverage. Although bathymetry processing is more automated than manual, due in part to the introduction of the Navigation Surface, imagery processing is almost entirely manual.

Two-step Process of Data Review

SAIC procedures for side-scan processing currently entail a two-step process of data review to mitigate missed targets. The first round of data scanning is performed by a junior hydrographer, and the subsequent verification of the data is performed by a more senior hydrographer. To reduce the labour required to proÂ­cess the hydrographic imagery data, and therefore improve the efficiency of imagery processing, SAIC determined that an automated process for object/target detection was needed for data processing.

The project was to develop an automated system capable of identifying natural as well as man-made targets (objects) on the seafloor with dimensions of one cubic metre and larger, regardless of strength of return and/or shape. Requirements for false detection rates were set at 5% of the total number of targets detected, with a similarly ambitious desire to identify 95% of the objects that met the object's minimum dimensional specifications.

At the prototype level, the problem was to design and implement a suite of software components to automatically detect bottom targets and then classify those detections as either legitimate or false detections to reduce the number of automatic detections a hydrographer would need to review. A generalised pro­cess flow is as follows:

Automatically detect bottom targets from test side-scan sonar data sets. Review automatic detections to provide a ground truth data set (performed by trained hydrographers). Extract parameters from each detection (for example, shape and texture). Automatically measure the length, width and height of each detection. Train neural net classifiers on reviewed subsets of detections to classify detections as legitimate or false alarms. Apply the trained neural net to entire reviewed data sets and provide uncertainty metrics.

Although the project at its most practical level was to develop a system that would decrease the labour associated with reviewing side-scan sonar data and provide efficiency to data processing for hydrographic surveys, this technology has wide applications in areas such as harbour security, munitions detection and other such applications.

To date, the prototype software has been completed and applied to a large volume of test data from hydrographic surveys performed by SAIC for NOAA. The test data were drawn from two surveys in similar oceanographic environments using different side-scan sonars. Both areas were surveyed with a 50m range setting on the side-scan sonar and 40m line spacing, resulting in 200% side-scan coverage. Sheet F (registry number H11241) was a survey of the approaches to Little Egg and Brigantine Inlets off the coast of New Jersey. Sheet F was surveyed with a Klein 2000 side-scan sonar and consists of 378 XTF files that span over 40 survey days. Sheet H (registry number H11455) was a survey of Holgate to Beach Haven Crest, just north of Sheet F. Sheet H (Figure 1) was surveyed with a Klein 3000 side-scan sonar and consists of 613 XTF files that span over 29 survey days. A total of 24,726 automatic detections from both sheets were comprehensively reviewed by hydrographers to provide a ground truth data set of legitimate targets and false alarms.

Detection

Simply stated, the detection algorithm is designed to find a peak followed by a shadow. The detection processing makes use of a split-window normal­isation scheme commonly referred to as Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection. Conceptually, the algorithm assigns the targets contained in a side-scan image with a score that is proportional to the area of the front of the object, or width by height. Peak and shadow scores are computed individually on all side-scan channels and combined to a target score that triggers detection above a prescribed threshold.

As sand waves often have a signature similar to targets on the seafloor (a strong return on the near face of the sand wave and a shadow) and can therefore result in thousands of false detections, the detection processing includes a 2-dimensional median wave-number filter to suppress sand waves and other background interference. Post-detection processing, such as the application of linear prediction filters, is also applied to the raw data to remove unwanted textures or global trends that affect the parameters and measurements that are extracted from each detection window.

Processing and Measurements

Integration of image processing functions into the processing stream enables image filtering, segmentation, small-object detection and simple feature extraction. The parameter extraction code operates on black and white as well as greyscale images of the peak and shadow scores. A total of 172 parameters are extracted from raw and processed detection images. The resulting image parameter set captures shape, texture and stat­istical moments of the detected targets. An important step in parameterextraction is the determination of the image processing window within the detection window shown in Figure 3. These windows are based on the automated analysis and thresÂ­holding of the score images resulting in elliptical regions, which isolate the target and its shadow. The moment and texture parameters extracted from these windows are used for classifier training and target measurement determination (length, width and height).

Neural Network Training

The design sensitivity of the detector ensures a high probability of detection at the cost of a large number of false detections. However, this does not necessarily degrade the target identification capability when an effective classification scheme is employed. For this reason, the prototype code for the identification of targets uses multi-layer perceptron networks in association with statistical confidence metrics to manage false alarms.

The essential problem in the use of most neural network classification schemes based on error-minimisation techniques is to find a classifier that represents a model of the data as opposed to a memorisation. To achieve this balance, the ratio of training examples (detections) to network connection weights must be large (>10:1). To reduce the number of weights and increase the ratio, the parameters for the neural net input are selected to maximise the statistical distance between the real and false contacts (targets) and to minimise the correlation among the various image parameters.

The neural network to be trained was configured with eleven hidden layer nodes and thirty input image parameters. The training algorithm therefore attempts to minimise classification error using a total of 330 (30 x 11) estimated connection weights. In this case, a randomised sample of 5,000 reviewed detections is sufficient compared with the number of weights expressed as a ratio of about 15:1. Although the optimisation problem is now over-determined, constraints such as these typically increase confidence in the ability to apply a classifier to surveyed data from other geographical regions.

The results after applying the network trained on 5,000 examples to the entire set of 24,726 detections are presented in the confusion matrix shown in Figure 4. This neural network correctly classified 1,418 targets and 21,850 false alarms (clutter). However, it incorrectly classified 1,348 false alarms (clutter) as targets and 110 real targets as false alarms (clutter). Therefore, the classification results of the current single-stage neural network are a 93% probability of detection and a 6% probability of false alarm.

Uncertainty Metrics

The classification of features as targets or clutter is based on network activation values. Statistical analysis of the distribution of network activations for each class allows the identification of uncertain classifications. In the single classification example shown in Figure 5, the network activ­ation (green circle) is plotted along with beta distributions fit to the network activations from the entire training set shown on the right. In this case, the example was correctly classified as a real target. However, in many cases, the classification is on the tails of either distribution, making the decision more difficult. In such cases, the activation distributions can be used either to define the crossover decision point or quantify the classification in terms of a confidence level.

The activation distributions are also very useful in optimising the false alarm and detection rates. An N-stage network was developed recursively from the uncertain examples resulting from a series of training sessions using progressively larger confidence levels. This generates a receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-type analysis where detector sensitivity is analogous to confidence level. The ROC curve shown in Figure 6 was derived from a three-stage neural network where confidence levels from 0.5 to 0.95 resulted in the probabilities of detection and false alarm shown on the X and Y axes, respectively.

Summary and Future Directions

Although the prototype offers a convincing proof of concept (93% probability of detection and 6% probability of false alarm for a single-stage neural network), future success will depend largely on effective integration and fast implementations of existing software. The extraction of small targets requires the processing of side-scan data at its full resolution, which has demonstrated the need for accelerated processing speeds well in excess of those used in the prototyping phase. Consequently, continued test-bed development for fast and flexible image processing and analysis of side-scan data appears to be critical.

In the coming year, SAIC also plans to implement active learning strategies that allow the system to learn as new data are acquired. This specifically addresses classifier portability, which is the key element in the application of the automated feature-detection system to hydrographic surveys in new regions using other survey instruments.

A culmination of the current efforts in this technology area will be the development and testing of a near-real-time operational system, which will include sophisticated data-visual­isation schemes to enhance the data-review process.

Context: [RetrieverResultItem(content='{\'id\': \':0\', \'index\': 0, \'text\': "Side-scan sonar is well accepted as a tool for detection and visualisation of underwater objects and is widely used in support of safety of navigation surveys. Although side-scan sonars produce excellent images, these images are often difficult and time-consuming to review and analyse. These images typically contain spurious features and artefacts due to acoustic phenomena, such as refraction, and bottom characteristics, such as sand waves that result in a large number of false contacts. This article describes a research and development effort at Science Applications International Corporation to develop and apply advanced processing techniques in bottom target detection and image classification to support the automation of side-scan sonar data processing.\\n\\nShallow-water hydrographic surveys typically involve the collection of concurrent bathymetric and side-scan sonar data. Recent developments in bathymetric data processing within the hydrographic community have allowed for a decrease in the labour effort to process data while at the same time providing potentially superior data products. Over the past several years, the Acoustic and Marine Systems Operation within Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) has been involved in an internal research and development project to reduce the labour required to process the other sonar data type side-scan sonar.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Marine Science and Technology Division of SAIC, located in Newport (RI, USA), performs a wide range of marine survey operations, with hydrographic surveys representing a major component of these. Most hydrographic surveys that SAIC has performed since 1994 (when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] first contracted out hydrographic surveys to private industry) have required 200% side-scan coverage, with resulting multi-beam bathymetry coverage. Although bathymetry processing is more automated than manual, due in part to the introduction of the Navigation Surface, imagery processing is almost entirely manual.\\n\\nTwo-step Process of Data Review\\n\\nSAIC procedures for side-scan processing currently entail a two-step process of data review to mitigate missed targets. The first round of data scanning is performed by a junior hydrographer, and the subsequent verification of the data is performed by a more senior hydrographer. To reduce the labour required to proÂ\\xadcess the hydrographic imagery data, and therefore improve the efficiency of imagery processing, SAIC determined that an automated process for object/target detection was needed for data processing.\\n\\nThe project was to develop an automated system capable of identifying natural as well as man-made targets (objects) on the seafloor with dimensions of one cubic metre and larger, regardless of strength of return and/or shape. Requirements for false detection rates were set at 5% of the total number of targets detected, with a similarly ambitious desire to identify 95% of the objects that met the object\'s minimum dimensional specifications.\\n\\nAt the prototype level, the problem was to design and implement a suite of software components to automatically detect bottom targets and then classify those detections as either legitimate or false detections to reduce the number of automatic detections a hydrographer would need to review. A generalised pro\\xadcess flow is as follows:\\n\\nAutomatically detect bottom targets from test side-scan sonar data sets. Review automatic detections to provide a ground truth data set (performed by trained hydrographers). Extract parameters from each detection (for example, shape and texture). Automatically measure the length, width and height of each detection. Train neural net classifiers on reviewed subsets of detections to classify detections as legitimate or false alarms. Apply the trained neural net to entire reviewed data sets and provide uncertainty metrics.\\n\\nAlthough the project at its most practical level was to develop a system that would decrease the labour associated with reviewing side-scan sonar data and provide efficiency to data processing for hydrographic surveys, this technology has wide applications in areas such as harbour security, munitions detection and other such applications.\\n\\nTo date, the prototype software has been completed and applied to a large volume of test data from hydrographic surveys performed by SAIC for NOAA. The test data were drawn from two surveys in similar oceanographic environments using different side-scan sonars. Both areas were surveyed with a 50m range setting on the side-scan sonar and 40m line spacing, resulting in 200% side-scan coverage. Sheet F (registry number H11241) was a survey of the approaches to Little Egg and Brigantine Inlets off the coast of New Jersey. Sheet F was surveyed with a Klein 2000 side-scan sonar and consists of 378 XTF files that span over 40 survey days. Sheet H (registry number H11455) was a survey of Holgate to Beach Haven Crest, just north of Sheet F. Sheet H (Figure 1) was surveyed with a Klein 3000 side-scan sonar and consists of 613 XTF files that span over 29 survey days. A total of 24,726 automatic detections from both sheets were comprehensively reviewed by hydrographers to provide a ground truth data set of legitimate targets and false alarms.\\n\\nDetection\\n\\nSimply stated, the detection algorithm is designed to find a peak followed by a shadow. The detection processing makes use of a split-window normal\\xadisation scheme commonly referred to as Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection. Conceptually, the algorithm assigns the targets contained in a side-scan image with a score that is proportional to the area of the front of the object, or width by height. Peak and shadow scores are computed individually on all side-scan channels and combined to a target score that triggers detection above a prescribed threshold.\\n\\nAs sand waves often have a signature similar to targets on the seafloor (a strong return on the near face of the sand wave and a shadow) and can therefore result in thousands of false detections, the detection processing includes a 2-dimensional median wave-number filter to suppress sand waves and other background interference. Post-detection processing, such as the application of linear prediction filters, is also applied to the raw data to remove unwanted textures or global trends that affect the parameters and measurements that are extracted from each detection window.\\n\\nProcessing and Measurements\\n\\nIntegration of image processing functions into the processing stream enables image filtering, segmentation, small-object detection and simple feature extraction. The parameter extraction code operates on black and white as well as greyscale images of the peak and shadow scores. A total of 172 parameters are extracted from raw and processed detection images. The resulting image parameter set captures shape, texture and stat\\xadistical moments of the detected targets. An important step in parameterextraction is the determination of the image processing window within the detection window shown in Figure 3. These windows are based on the automated analysis and thresÂ\\xadholding of the score images resulting in elliptical regions, which isolate the target and its shadow. The moment and texture parameters extracted from these windows are used for classifier training and target measurement determination (length, width and height).\\n\\nNeural Network Training\\n\\nThe design sensitivity of the detector ensures a high probability of detection at the cost of a large number of false detections. However, this does not necessarily degrade the target identification capability when an effective classification scheme is employed. For this reason, the prototype code for the identification of targets uses multi-layer perceptron networks in association with statistical confidence metrics to manage false alarms.\\n\\nThe essential problem in the use of most neural network classification schemes based on error-minimisation techniques is to find a classifier that represents a model of the data as opposed to a memorisation. To achieve this balance, the ratio of training examples (detections) to network connection weights must be large (>10:1). To reduce the number of weights and increase the ratio, the parameters for the neural net input are selected to maximise the statistical distance between the real and false contacts (targets) and to minimise the correlation among the various image parameters.\\n\\nThe neural network to be trained was configured with eleven hidden layer nodes and thirty input image parameters. The training algorithm therefore attempts to minimise classification error using a total of 330 (30 x 11) estimated connection weights. In this case, a randomised sample of 5,000 reviewed detections is sufficient compared with the number of weights expressed as a ratio of about 15:1. Although the optimisation problem is now over-determined, constraints such as these typically increase confidence in the ability to apply a classifier to surveyed data from other geographical regions.\\n\\nThe results after applying the network trained on 5,000 examples to the entire set of 24,726 detections are presented in the confusion matrix shown in Figure 4. This neural network correctly classified 1,418 targets and 21,850 false alarms (clutter). However, it incorrectly classified 1,348 false alarms (clutter) as targets and 110 real targets as false alarms (clutter). Therefore, the classification results of the current single-stage neural network are a 93% probability of detection and a 6% probability of false alarm.\\n\\nUncertainty Metrics\\n\\nThe classification of features as targets or clutter is based on network activation values.

Millions of people living in the United States take care of a friend or family member with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia. Sometimes caregivers live with the person or nearby, other times they live far away. For many families, caring for a person with dementia isn’t just one person’s job, but the role of many people who share tasks and responsibilities. No matter what kind of caregiver you are, taking care of another person can be overwhelming at times. These tips and suggestions may help with everyday care and tasks.\\n\\nTips for Everyday Care for People With Dementia Early on in Alzheimer’s and related dementias, people experience changes in thinking, remembering, and reasoning in a way that affects daily life and activities. Eventually, people with these diseases will need more help with simple, everyday tasks. This may include bathing, grooming, and dressing. It may be upsetting to the person to need help with such personal activities. Here are a few tips to consider early on and as the disease progresses: Try to keep a routine, such as bathing, dressing, and eating at the same time each day.\\n\\nHelp the person write down to-do lists, appointments, and events in a notebook or calendar.\\n\\nPlan activities that the person enjoys and try to do them at the same time each day.\\n\\nConsider a system or reminders for helping those who must take medications regularly.\\n\\nWhen dressing or bathing, allow the person to do as much as possible.\\n\\nBuy loose-fitting, comfortable, easy-to-use clothing, such as clothes with elastic waistbands, fabric fasteners, or large zipper pulls instead of shoelaces, buttons, or buckles.\\n\\nUse a sturdy shower chair to support a person who is unsteady and to prevent falls. You can buy shower chairs at drug stores and medical supply stores.\\n\\nBe gentle and respectful. Tell the person what you are going to do, step by step while you help them bathe or get dressed.\\n\\nServe meals in a consistent, familiar place and give the person enough time to eat.\\n\\nCaregivers and Clinical Trials Volunteering for clinical trials can help caregivers find resources and support. Location Location Search Find a clinical trial for caregivers\\n\\nTips for Changes in Communication and Behavior for People With Dementia Communication can be hard for people with Alzheimer’s and related dementias because they have trouble remembering things. They also can become agitated and anxious, even angry. In some forms of dementia, language abilities are affected such that people have trouble finding the right words or have difficulty speaking. You may feel frustrated or impatient, but it is important to understand that the disease is causing the change in communication skills. To help make communication easier, you can: Reassure the person. Speak calmly. Listen to his or her concerns and frustrations. Try to show that you understand if the person is angry or fearful.\\n\\nAllow the person to keep as much control in his or her life as possible.\\n\\nRespect the person’s personal space.\\n\\nBuild quiet times into the day, along with activities.\\n\\nKeep well-loved objects and photographs around the house to help the person feel more secure.\\n\\nRemind the person who you are if he or she doesn’t remember, but try not to say, “Don’t you remember?”\\n\\nEncourage a two-way conversation for as long as possible.\\n\\nTry distracting the person with an activity, such as a familiar book or photo album, if you are having trouble communicating with words.\\n\\nTips for a Healthy and Active Lifestyle for People With Dementia Eating healthy and staying active is good for everyone and is especially important for people with Alzheimer’s and related dementias. As the disease progresses, finding ways for the person to eat healthy foods and stay active may be increasingly challenging. Here are some tips that may help: Consider different activities the person can do to stay active, such as household chores, cooking and baking, exercise, and gardening. Match the activity to what the person can do.\\n\\nHelp get an activity started or join in to make the activity more fun. People with dementia may lack interest or initiative and can have trouble starting activities. But, if others do the planning, they may join in.\\n\\nAdd music to exercises or activities if it helps motivate the person. Dance to the music if possible.\\n\\nBe realistic about how much activity can be done at one time. Several short “mini-workouts” may be best.\\n\\nTake a walk together each day.

Answer: Mining all Seafloor Massive Sulfides (SMS) on the deep sea would likely have significant and potentially irreversible impacts on deep-sea ecosystems. The process would involve massive machines digging, dredging, and vacuuming up the ocean floor, creating huge sediment plumes that could drift on currents and smother marine life, including undiscovered species. The destruction of the seabed could lead to the extinction of species and the loss of complex ecosystems supported by the nodules. Additionally, surface-level processing ships would dump tailings back into the ocean, releasing acidic and toxic sediment that is hazardous to marine life and those who consume it. Overall, deep-sea mining could result in enormous environmental damage and biodiversity loss.

One traditional belief in this regard has been that competition should be more intense in the benign and productive side of an environmental gradient, whereas the intensity decreases toward harsh conditions (i.e., stress gradient hypothesis; Bertness and Callaway 1994; Maestre et al. 2009; Holmgren and Scheffer 2010; Lee et al. 2018a, 2018b). In the former case, a (few) strong competitor(s) will outcompete inferior ones, thereby resulting in low-level diversity. In the latter, very high stresses allow only highly tolerant species to survive (i.e., reduction of species pool), and thus, species diversity is expected to be low. Intermediate-level harshness is predicted to compromise these two extreme situations and maximize biodiversity because a certain level of stresses prevents a superior competitor from monopolizing available resources, and such stresses secure space for stable populations of inferior species. In sum, retarded competitive exclusion because of physical harshness has been considered a major factor contributing to the maintenance of species coexistence (Grime 2001; Hart and Marshall 2013). Indeed, this notion provides the basis for influential classical theories of non-equilibrium coexistence, such as patch dynamics (Pickett 1980), the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell 1978), and Huston’s (1979) dynamic equilibrium model.\\n\\nThere are at least two theories associated with niche differentiation, indicating that one can observe high biodiversity even under highly stressful conditions. First, Tilman’s (1985) resource-ratio hypothesis suggests that high-level species coexistence can be achieved at low resource levels because the coexisting plants experience their environment as inherently spatially variable more than at high levels of resources. In a somewhat different context, Chesson and Huntly (1997) propose that stable coexistence may result easily from classical resource partitioning when strong environmental harshness makes existing tolerant species more equal in demographic rates. They conclude that, although harshness itself cannot stabilize species coexistence, it may facilitate or broaden the effects of other diversity-stabilizing mechanisms, such as resource partitioning and niche differentiation. In addition, facilitative biological interactions can be another important mechanism of species coexistence under environmental harshness (He and Berness 2014), as has been demonstrated in salt marshes (Bertness and Shumway 1993), arid ecosystems (Maestre and Cortina 2004), and alpine ecosystems (Callaway et al. 2002).\\n\\nTheory IV: coexistence under non-equilibrium versus equilibrium conditions\\n\\nMost of the environmental stress models discussed above exhibit one common characteristic that an important (and often imperative) component is the role of disturbance in shaping community structure and patterns of species diversity. Such a strong emphasis on disturbance implies that species coexistence is maintained under non-equilibrium states, in which disturbance events are frequent and strong enough to prevent a system from returning to its previous ecological phase before another disturbance event occurs (Connell 1978; Chesson 2000; Araújo and Pearson 2005). Consequently, a question arises concerning the general applicability of current theories of coexistence to communities that exhibit stressful conditions but limited and infrequent disturbances, that is, communities where a degree of equilibrium might be attained.\\n\\nMany theorists have been optimistic that disturbance-related models will be applicable to many different types of communities (but see Fox 2013). However, for example, Locke’s (1992) classic analyses of zooplankton communities along pH gradients (i.e., acidification stress) did not support such an expectation. She argued that it is questionable whether the level of physical disturbance included in the conventional models is comparable to the actual level of stresses that plant species perceive and respond to (see also reviews by Mackey and Currie 2001; Hughes et al. 2007). In short, the traditional disturbance-based models may not be robust if species in a system experience non-lethal environmental harshness.\\n\\nTheory V: modern perspectives\\n\\nAlthough the validity of niche theory has been recognized in community ecology, it also has limitations. First, it is suggested that the niche itself is an abstract concept (Chase and Leibold 2003; Araújo and Guisan 2006; Soberón and Nakamura 2009). Ambiguities in the original formulation of fundamental and realized niche concepts often result in conflicting interpretations as to what is truly a niche in the ecological system (Araújo and Guisan 2006). Furthermore, niche theory assumes the existence of stable conditions in, for example, required resources for species, but whether such conditions actually exist or are readily detectable in reality remains elusive (Torres 1984).\\n\\nNeutral theory has also faced several criticisms, arising mainly from its assumption that species are functionally equivalent and thus all individual species within a community have the same chances of reproduction and mortality regardless of their characteristics (Theory II: coexistence without niche differentiation). In real-world communities, many species exhibit large differences in traits. Therefore, if neutrality holds, these differences should be prone to fitness-equalizing tradeoffs, which is extremely unlikely (Purves and Turnbull 2010). In addition, as Hubbell (2001) acknowledged, stochastic processes associated with neutral theory do not predict coexistence patterns well at local spatial scales (Jabot and Chave 2011; Pos et al. 2019). Related to this is the question of whether perceived neutral processes might result from non-neutral mechanisms (Alonso et al. 2006). This is because neutral theory aggregates and averages the information on community assembly processes across sites, and this will blur deterministic mechanisms, making them appear as neutral dynamics (Clark 2012). However, in the last two decades, the neutral theory perspective has often been used to explain community assembly especially at regional scales (Chave 2004; Rosindell et al. 2011, 2012; Black and McKane 2012; Chesson 2013; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; D’Andrea and Ostling 2016). In addition, due to its simplicity and tractability, the theory still serves as a useful null hypothesis for complex biodiversity patterns (Rosindell et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Munoz and Huneman 2016).\\n\\nDespite its drawbacks in assumption, prediction, and measurement (Pocheville 2015), niche theory has also advanced in the new millennium (Adler et al. 2007; HilleRisLambers et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Munoz and Huneman 2016; Letten et al. 2017; Barabás et al. 2018). Ambiguous definitions of niches have been redefined through quantitative approaches of modern coexistence theory (Chesson 2000; Letten et al. 2017). Modern coexistence theory is based on the Lotka–Volterra model and examines community structure in relation to the influence of environmental factors on species interactions (Chesson 2000, 2013; Adler et al. 2007; Ellner et al. 2019). In a theory-based model, complex interactions between species in a community are simplified into competition coefficients, which reflect intra- and inter-specific effects on per capita growth rate (Letten et al. 2017). Under modern coexistence theory, niche and fitness differences are controlling factors that allow species to coexist in the same community. The niche difference is part of a stabilizing mechanism that differentiates niches among species within a community to decrease competition and thus optimize the chance of survival. On the contrary, the equalizing mechanism balances fitness differences between species, thereby contributing to species coexistence (HilleRisLambers et al. 2012). The stabilizing niche differences can be reduced as the average fitness differences decrease. In other words, when niche differences are larger than relative fitness differences, species in a community can stably coexist (Chesson 2000).\\n\\nContemporary niche theory is developed from the consumer–resource model (Tilman 1982) and provides an explicit basis for coexistence (Chase and Leibold 2003). While Tilman’s model focuses on the dynamics of the consumer–resource system, Chase and Leibold (2003) expand the range of this model from interactions between biotic factors to interactions between biotic and abiotic factors (Letten et al. 2017). A major difference between modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory lies in the ways they define niche. For modern coexistence theory, boundaries of niches are defined through an interaction between two or more species. Under contemporary niche theory, in contrast, niches indicate particular traits of an individual species, and the niches of multiple species within a community can sometimes overlap.\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been a growing body of researchers trying to integrate the niche and neutral perspectives (Adler et al. 2007; Chisholm and Pacala 2010; Pigolotti and Cencini 2013; Kalyuzhny et al. 2015). In particular, a number of studies have demonstrated theoretically and empirically that both niche-based stabilizing mechanisms and neutral-based equalizing mechanisms appear to operate simultaneously along the continuum of environmental stress gradients in many ecological systems (Gravel et al. 2006; Mutshinda and O’Hara 2011; Jeraldo et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Scheffer et al. 2018; Ellner et al. 2019; Kim 2019). Accordingly, the focus today is increasingly on understanding the relative importance of these two mechanisms for species composition and diversity under different environmental conditions (Smith and Lundholm 20', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.6859557628631592, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:861'}), RetrieverResultItem(content="{'id': ':2', 'index': 2, 'text': '10; Chase and Myers 2011; Tuomisto et al. 2012). In particular, it is recently proposed that deterministic processes gain importance and stochastic processes lose importance as a community enters a regime of more stressful conditions (e.g., Chase 2007, 2010; Guo et al. 2014; cf. Lepori and Malmqvist 2009). That is, if a system is under harshness, only a small subset of the regional species pool can pass through the associated environmental filters. Because the resulting species richness is low, the probability of ecological drift will reduce, leading to a community likely assembled by niche-driven processes (i.e., weak stochasticity) (Kim 2019).\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThis review of the major coexistence theories provides four insights. First, there are few general models that can be applied to many ecological systems with convincing results. Even the widely accepted niche differentiation hypothesis has faced strongly opposing viewpoints (especially from the competitive combining ability hypothesis) over decades. The contrasting theories of niche differentiation and competitive combining ability (or neutrality) are the key interests of this present work. Second, the lack of general models implies that ecologists are still far from understanding the mechanisms of species coexistence under harsh environmental conditions. Much remains to be discovered (e.g., coexistence by or without niche differentiation), beyond the hypothesis that the intensity of competitive interactions weakens near the stressful end of physical gradients. Third, due to the conventional emphasis on disturbance, stressful systems with non-lethal conditions have not received the attention they deserve. The ecology of such systems will be increasingly important as global climate change extends the period of chronic stresses that are not necessarily fatal to inhabiting plants. Finally, for decades, theories have been presented, but further empirical insights are required based on field data to test the various coexistence models at different spatial scales and in different ecosystems. We do not claim that our current research resolves these four issues. Rather, this paper provides a set of observational species composition data from a single marsh system, in which plant communities experience non-lethal stresses along an environmental gradient; it should be considered a springboard for more extensive experimental research in various ecological systems.\\n\\nHypothesis\\n\\nIn this research, we address a fundamental question, what are the patterns and possible mechanisms of plant species coexistence under very harsh but non-lethal environmental conditions? To rephrase, the community to be tested is not directly influenced by high-magnitude disturbing forces but shows a certain level of “well-defined, autogenic developmental trends” (Odum 1985). We broadly hypothesize that there will be an overall trend in species diversity along environmental stress gradients at the study marsh. In particular, following the general explanations of the environmental stress models explained above (Theory III: coexistence along environmental stress gradients), we expect that the highest diversity will be observed at the intermediate-level stresses along the environmental gradient we examine. However, this hypothesis might be rejected if, for example, we observe unexpectedly high species diversity even under very stressful conditions.\\n\\nPianka (1974), in his classic niche overlap hypothesis, predicted that the maximum tolerable niche overlap between two species should be an inverse function of the intensity of inter-specific competition. Therefore, both decreasing overlap (i.e., niche differentiation) and increasing species diversity will indicate highly intense diffuse competition (i.e., native species in a community compete among themselves). A corollary of this idea is that high-level species diversity implies high-level diffuse competition (MacArthur 1972), which in turn significantly lowers niche overlap (see also Russell et al. 1985; Silvertown 2004). We embody these ideas as a conceptual model along a resource gradient at different levels of species diversity (Fig. 1). In the model, we hypothesize that high diversity is maintained by niche differentiation and is associated with intense diffuse competition. In the case of low diversity, reduced competition allows niche overlap (i.e., resource sharing) to increase. Assuming that the three systems with different levels of species diversity in the model possess the same extent of resource niches, we expect that niche breadth should be high where diversity is low and low where diversity is high. Niche breadth is a measure of the evenness of resource utilization by species along given niche dimensions (Levins 1968). High and low niche breadths (i.e., high and low evenness) are, therefore, indicative of generalist and specialist species, respectively (Vandermeer 1972; Gravel et al. 2006; Finke and Snyder 2008).', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.6799557209014893, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:862'})]

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES

Ransomware is an ever-evolving form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption. These resources are designed to help individuals and organizations prevent attacks that can severely impact business processes and leave organizations without the data they need to operate and deliver mission-critical services.
Ransomware poses a threat to you and your device, but what makes this form of malware so special? The word "ransom" tells you everything you need to know about this pest. Ransomware is extortion software that can lock your computer and then demand a ransom for its release.

In most cases, ransomware infection occurs as follows. The malware first gains access to the device. Depending on the type of ransomware, either the entire operating system or individual files are encrypted. A ransom is then demanded from the victim. If you want to minimize the risk of a ransomware attack, you should rely on high-quality ransomware protection software.

Ransomware: part of the malware family

Malware is a portmanteau of the words "malicious" and "software". The term malware therefore covers all malicious software that can be dangerous to your computer. This includes viruses and Trojans.

How to detect ransomware and protect yourself from it

When it comes to protecting against ransomware, prevention is better than cure. To achieve this, a watchful eye and the right security software are crucial. Vulnerability scans can also help you to find intruders in your system. First, it's important to make sure your computer is not an ideal target for ransomware. Device software should always be kept up to date in order to benefit from the latest security patches. In addition, careful action, especially with regard to rogue websites and email attachments, is vital. But even the best preventive measures can fail, making it all the more essential to have a contingency plan. In the case of ransomware, a contingency plan consists of having a backup of your data. To learn how to create a backup and what additional measures you can put in place to protect your device, read the article Ransomware protection: How to keep your data safe in 2022.

Fighting encryption Trojans – you can do it!

The most common ransomware infection routes include visiting malicious websites, downloading a malicious attachment or via unwanted add-ons during downloads. A single careless moment is enough to trigger to a ransomware attack. Since malware is designed to remain undetected for as long as possible, it is difficult to identify an infection. A ransomware attack is most likely to be detected by security software.

Obviously, changes to file extensions, increased CPU activity and other dubious activity on your computer may indicate an infection. When removing ransomware, there are basically three options available to you. The first is to pay the ransom, which is definitely not recommended. It is therefore best to try to remove the ransomware from your computer. If this is not possible, only one step remains: you will need to reset your computer to factory settings.

What forms of ransomware are there and what does that mean for you?

As mentioned above, the threat posed by ransomware depends on the variant of the virus. The first thing to consider is that there are two main categories of ransomware: locker ransomware and crypto ransomware. These can be distinguished as follows:

Locker ransomware – basic computer functions are affected

– basic computer functions are affected Crypto ransomware – individual files are encrypted

The type of malware also makes a significant difference when it comes to identifying and dealing with the ransomware. Within the two main categories, distinctions are made between numerous additional types of ransomware. These include, for example, Locky, WannaCry, and Bad Rabbit.

History of ransomware

Blackmailing computer users in this way is not a 21st century invention. As early as 1989, a primitive pioneer of ransomware was used. The first concrete cases of ransomware were reported in Russia in 2005. Since then, ransomware has spread all over the world, with new types continuing to prove successful. In 2011, a dramatic increase in ransomware attacks was observed. In the course of further attacks, manufacturers of antivirus software have increasingly focused their virus scanners on ransomware, especially since 2016.

Regional differences can often be seen in the various ransomware attacks. For example:

Incorrect messages about unlicensed applications:

In some countries, Trojans notify the victim that unlicensed software is installed on their computer. The message then prompts the user to make a payment.

False claims about illegal content:

In countries where illegal software downloads are common practice, this approach is not particularly successful for cybercriminals. Instead, ransomware messages claim that they are from law enforcement agencies and that child pornography or other illegal content has been found on the victim's computer. The message also contains a demand for a penalty fee to be paid.

The largest ransomware attack

One of the largest and most serious ransomware attacks took place in the spring of 2017 and was called WannaCry. In the course of the attack, approximately 200,000 victims from roughly 150 countries were asked to pay a ransom in Bitcoin.

Conclusion

Ransomware in all its forms and variants poses a significant threat both to private users and companies. This makes it all the more important to keep an eye on the threat it poses and to be prepared for all eventualities. It is therefore essential to learn about ransomware, to be highly conscious of how you use devices, and to install the best security software.

Answer: To prevent the further spread of ransomware and minimize operational downtime in the event of a sophisticated attack on a company's critical infrastructure, the following strategies and countermeasures can be implemented:

1. **High-Quality Ransomware Protection Software**: Ensure that the company uses advanced security software specifically designed to detect and prevent ransomware attacks. This software should be capable of performing real-time scans and blocking suspicious activities.

2. **Regular Software Updates**: Keep all device software up to date to benefit from the latest security patches. This reduces vulnerabilities that ransomware can exploit.

3. **Vulnerability Scans**: Conduct regular vulnerability scans to identify and address potential weaknesses in the system that could be exploited by ransomware.

4. **Employee Training and Awareness**: Educate employees about the risks of ransomware and the importance of cautious behavior, especially regarding rogue websites and email attachments.

5. **Data Backups**: Maintain regular backups of critical data. Ensure that backups are stored securely and are not connected to the main network to prevent them from being encrypted by ransomware.

6. **Network Segmentation**: Implement network segmentation to limit the spread of ransomware within the organization. This involves dividing the network into smaller, isolated segments to contain any potential infection.

7. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and regularly update an incident response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a ransomware attack. This plan should include communication protocols, roles and responsibilities, and recovery procedures.

8. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to limit user permissions and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to critical systems and data.

9. **Monitoring and Detection**: Use advanced monitoring tools to detect unusual activities and potential ransomware attacks early. This includes monitoring file extensions, CPU activity, and other indicators of compromise.

10. **Reset to Factory Settings**: If ransomware cannot be removed, be prepared to reset affected systems to factory settings as a last resort to eliminate the malware.

By implementing these strategies and countermeasures, a company can effectively prevent the spread of ransomware and minimize the impact on its critical infrastructure.

Answer: The context provided does not explicitly list the advantages and disadvantages of mercerizing a fabric before desizing, before bleaching, and after bleaching. However, it does mention some aspects of mercerization:

1. **Grey Mercerization**:
   - **Advantages**: 
     - One drying process is avoided, which is required in other cases before mercerization.
     - Removal of caustic is simpler in further processing.
   - **Disadvantages**: 
     - Requires the addition of powerful wetting agents due to the poor absorbency of grey cotton, which contains impurities like oil, wax, and sizing agents.

For a more detailed comparison of mercerizing at different stages (before desizing, before bleaching, and after bleaching), additional specific information would be needed. The context provided does not cover these specific stages comprehensively.

Although the sentiments from the participants were consistent across both for-profit and non-profit organizations, the research team decided that it would be better to remove the for-profit responses from the data, so as not to inappropriately over-generalize the insights. The research team has connected with the for-profit participants to let them know. Drawing conclusions from small-scale samples has risks. These risks can be mitigated, e.g., through a mixed-methods approach using additional methods such as surveys and data analysis to triangulate findings. Researcher bias in interpreting and prioritizing the results is another risk.

Risk-Return Tradeoff WHAT IS THE Risk-Return Tradeoff The risk-return tradeoff states that the potential return rises with an increase in risk. Using this principle, individuals associate low levels of uncertainty with low potential returns, and high levels of uncertainty or risk with high potential returns. According to the risk-return tradeoff, invested money can render higher profits only if the investor will accept a higher possibility of losses. BREAKING DOWN Risk-Return Tradeoff The risk-return tradeoff is the trading principle that links high risk with high reward. The appropriate risk-return tradeoff depends on a variety of factors including an investor’s risk tolerance, the investor’s
Answer: Based on the context provided, the decision between high profit and high risk versus low profit and low risk should consider the risk-return tradeoff principle. This principle states that higher potential returns are associated with higher risks. The appropriate choice depends on factors such as the organization's risk tolerance and strategic goals. If the organization is willing to accept a higher possibility of losses for the chance of higher profits, the high profit and high risk option may be preferred. Conversely, if the organization prioritizes stability and minimizing potential losses, the low profit and low risk option would be more suitable. Without additional specific information about the organization's risk tolerance and strategic objectives, a definitive recommendation cannot be made.

Answer: The context provided does not directly relate to the question about campaign design and decision-making between high profit/high risk and low profit/low risk options. However, I can offer a general approach to making such a decision:

When deciding between a high profit/high risk option and a low profit/low risk option, consider the following factors:

1. **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your or your organization's ability to handle potential losses. If you have a high risk tolerance, the high profit/high risk option might be more appealing.

2. **Financial Stability**: Consider the current financial health of your organization. If you have a strong financial cushion, you might be more inclined to take on higher risks.

3. **Strategic Goals**: Align the decision with your long-term strategic goals. If rapid growth is a priority, the high profit/high risk option might be more suitable.

4. **Market Conditions**: Evaluate the current market environment. In a volatile market, a low risk option might be safer.

5. **Stakeholder Preferences**: Consider the preferences and expectations of stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers.

Ultimately, the decision should align with your overall strategy, risk appetite, and the specific circumstances of your organization.

Answer: In a situation where a natural disaster has left many people homeless, policies could be put in place to provide adequate housing and resources for those affected while also promoting long-term recovery and sustainability by:

1. **Identifying Temporary or Permanent Shelter Options**: Establishing temporary shelters and working towards permanent housing solutions for displaced individuals. This includes ensuring that shelters are inclusive and accessible to all, including those who identify as LGBTQ+ or have pets.

2. **Connecting with Local Service Providers**: Collaborating with local service providers to ensure that individuals continue to receive necessary services after the disaster. This includes mental health support, substance use-related assistance, and other essential services.

3. **Providing Mental Health Support**: Assuring individuals that experiencing mental health and substance use-related reactions is common after a disaster and that help is available. Sharing coping skills and providing debriefing and follow-up check-ins for service providers and outreach workers.

4. **Promoting Partnerships**: Continuing to promote partnerships with local homeless service providers, emergency shelters, and healthcare professionals to ensure preparedness and community unity.

Answer: In a situation where a natural disaster has left many people homeless, several policies could be implemented to provide adequate housing and resources while promoting long-term recovery and sustainability:

1. **Temporary and Permanent Housing Solutions**: Establish temporary shelters and work towards providing permanent housing options. Ensure these shelters are inclusive and accessible to all, including those who identify as LGBTQ+ or have pets.

2. **Support Services**: Connect individuals with local service providers who can offer ongoing support after the disaster. This includes mental health and substance use-related services, as many disaster survivors may experience related reactions.

3. **Community Partnerships**: Promote partnerships with local homeless service providers, emergency shelters, and healthcare professionals to ensure preparedness and community unity. This collaboration can help streamline resources and support services.

4. **Environmental and Infrastructure Considerations**: Address the disproportionate effects on low-income households, such as proximity to environmental pollutant sources and reliance on public transportation. Ensure infrastructure is rebuilt with resilience in mind to withstand future disasters.

5. **Educational Support**: Provide resources to schools in affected areas to rebuild and offer appropriate developmental and educational supports for children.

6. **Financial Assistance**: Offer financial resources and tax relief opportunities to those affected, particularly low-income households, to aid in their recovery.

7. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Federal agencies should monitor the effects of disasters on vulnerable populations and allocate funds to address these issues, ensuring that activities consider the broader impacts on these communities.

By implementing these policies, communities can better support those affected by natural disasters and work towards sustainable recovery and resilience.

Answer: The context suggests that the anti-malarial artemisinin-derivative artesunate has been shown to be effective against a number of Babesia species and to have efficacy against human cerebral malaria. It was hypothesized that concomitant administration of artesunate in Lyme borreliosis patients would help alleviate the severity of self-reported short-term memory impairment. This hypothesis was tested in a small pilot study where patients were treated with both an intravenous antibiotic and artesunate. Therefore, the approach of using artesunate in conjunction with an intravenous antibiotic has been explored for its potential effectiveness in treating severe short-term memory impairment associated with Lyme borreliosis and Babesia co-infection.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Traveling sustainably is about making intentional choices to serve your destination and planet well.

We asked experts how to make these choices when planning a trip to be as sustainable as possible.

This article is part of "Better Me," a series about improving your lifestyle and helping society through sustainable efforts and eco-consciousness.

Sustainable travel can feel like an oxymoron — as Justin Francis, the cofounder and CEO of Responsible Travel, a UK-based travel company that evaluates trips and vacation providers, told Insider.

The travel industry can create jobs, or it can lead to over-tourism that lowers residents' quality of life. Flights emit harmful emissions, but transport travelers to destinations where they can support local economies and participate in positive, nature-based tourism. Lodging accommodations can boost the local economy, or price residents out of their homes.

But Francis believes people can travel "in a way that not only reduces harm but actively maximizes the benefits, for both planet and people."

Five other sustainable travel experts who spoke with Insider agree and say there are actions travelers can take to lower their negative impact, support the destinations they're visiting, and have an overall better trip. They suggest considering every aspect of your trip — from where you go to how you get there — as you plan to travel more sustainably.

Kelley Louise, the executive director and founder of Impact Travel Alliance, a nonprofit centered on informing travelers to help improve the world, told Insider that traveling sustainably takes practice and being an imperfect traveler is better than not trying.

As Louise said, "It's about asking, 'How can you make little decisions that add up over time and have a positive impact on the world?'"

If you're looking for a place to start, here's what the experts Insider spoke with recommend.

First, choose a destination with the planet in mind

Abbey Lossing for Insider

Go off the beaten path

Some of the experts Insider spoke with suggest skipping top tourist destinations and opting for under-the-radar spots.

"By seeking out the less-visited destinations, you will be helping to spread the economic benefits of tourism more widely and helping to avoid the negative impacts that over-tourism has on local residents," Georgina Davies — the communications manager for The Travel Foundation, a group that advocates for sustainable tourism — told Insider.

Paloma Zapata agrees. The CEO of Sustainable Travel International — an organization that works with local governments, businesses, and nonprofits to provide sustainable travel opportunities — also recommends visiting a hidden gem. If you're going to Greece, for instance, you could skip Mykonos and head to an island like Anafi or Ios with fewer tourists.

Once you've picked your destination, Davies encourages travelers to visit the region's national parks and protected areas. Often these places have entrance fees, which support conservation efforts.

Choose a destination that embraces sustainability

Jessica Blotter, CEO and cofounder of public benefit corporation Kind Travel, told Insider she looks for destinations with tourism boards that have a dedicated sustainable travel section on their website.

She recommends avoiding areas where sustainable transportation and lodging are hard to find, and "where access to nature and the outdoors is limited."

Vacation during shoulder season

Tossing a coin in the Trevi Fountain without hordes of people around or exploring Niagara Falls in the winter isn't just beneficial to travelers; experts say it also supports sustainability.

Visiting destinations during shoulder seasons "spreads the benefits of tourism locally across the year and lightens the burden of over-tourism in popular destinations," Francis said. His company, Responsible Travel, has a guide that outlines the best time to visit certain destinations.

Zapata added that you're also more likely to have a stress-free and special vacation if you're visiting when there are fewer crowds. "It could be even more enriching," she said. "When you're on a beach or on a sailboat and it's just surrounded by masses of people, maybe that's not the best experience."

Visit fewer places for longer

One way to travel more responsibly is to visit fewer places for longer periods of time. For example, instead of spending a week in four European countries, plan a 10-day trip to one or two.

"Fewer but longer trips mean fewer air miles, more money in local hands, and you'll have a more relaxing trip, too," Francis said. "If you can, keep shorter trips close to home or travel by land or sea." He added that these modes of travel can be an adventure in themselves, and allow you to "see so much more of a destination."

If you must travel a long distance, Blotter recommends stretching the trip as much as possible to maximize your experience. "Booking multiple, long-haul trips per year is not sustainable or carbon-friendly," she said.

Consider how you get there

Abbey Lossing for Insider

Evaluate the distance for the most sustainable way to get there

The first step in deciding how to responsibly get to your destination is considering the number of people traveling and the distance you're going.

Besides biking and walking, trains are typically one of the most sustainable ways to travel, Zapata said. If your destination is accessible by train, consider that.

If you're debating whether it's more sustainable to fly or drive, Zapata said it comes down to the distance.

"A lot of times trains are going to be more energy and carbon efficient," she said. "But when it comes to a car, there comes a moment when flying is actually more carbon efficient than driving when you're talking about very long distances."

Calculators like the ones offered by the International Civil Aviation Organization and Environmental Defense Fund can help travelers map out the least carbon-intensive way to get from A to B.

If you need to fly, opt for nonstop routes and travel in economy

Flying will likely be the most unsustainable aspect of your trip. Aviation makes up about 2% of global carbon emissions and 80% of a vacation's carbon footprint comes from the flight, according to National Geographic.

Experts suggest thinking about how much you should fly in a year. For example, maybe you take one international flight a year and prioritize having the rest of your trips close to home, Louise said.

But no matter where you jet off to, experts recommend flying nonstop in economy.

"When booking long-distance plane travel, always choose a direct flight with no layovers," Blotter said. "Direct flights use less carbon dioxide than connecting flights."

Additionally, by flying in economy, as some of the experts Insider spoke with pointed out, you maximize the number of people a flight can carry by taking up less space.

Experts like Louise and Gregory Miller, the executive director of the international nonprofit Center for Responsible Travel, agree that carbon offsets act more like a Band-Aid than a solution to sustainable travel. But if they do decide to purchase carbon offsets, which reduce or remove emissions to compensate for those made during a trip, Miller suggests purchasing through a reliable, vetted program. Groups like Zapata's Sustainable Travel say they invest people's money into carbon-reducing projects centered on clean energy and biodiversity. Ultimately, though, the best thing you can do is reduce your carbon footprint during your trip.

Think about how you pack

Abbey Lossing for Insider

Pack light

The simplest advice when it comes to being a sustainable packer is to pack less, Zapata said. "Travel light," she said.

"You don't need 20 shoes to travel."

Blotter agrees and says that by packing lighter, you'll reduce carbon emissions. That's because the lighter the aircraft, train, car, or boat, the less energy is needed.

Louise added that by packing fewer items and using a carry-on, you'll get through security faster and avoid the hassle of checking a bag.

Pack reusable items

Francis suggests adding the items you use at home to your packing list. That might include a reusable water bottle, a bag for shopping, and utensils to avoid plastic cutlery.

Louise acknowledges that it might not be feasible for every traveler to carry a reusable water bottle, so she urges travelers to consider what other meaningful swaps they could make. For example, Louise said she swapped liquid shampoo and conditioner for shampoo and conditioner bars a few vacations back. The bars are lighter than liquid soaps, which means they save carbon emissions during transportation. Plus, many are packaged in recyclable paper instead of plastic.

The switch became permanent in Louise's daily life, she said, adding that it made traveling easier since she didn't have to worry about leaks or liquids at airport security. "It's a cool example of how we can look for more sustainable experiences that are also better travel experiences," she said. "Plus it opens our eyes to new habits that can help us become more conscious consumers as well."

Pack brands you support

If you're doing some pre-vacation shopping, Louise recommends buying from brands that place sustainability at the forefront of their business.

"If you're supporting corporations and brands that are working on sustainability as well, then that's going to move the needle and create change a lot quicker than we could as individuals," she said.

For tropical getaways, pack reef-safe sunscreen

If you're heading to Aruba or planning a diving trip in Belize, experts say travelers should ensure reef-safe sunscreen is on their packing lists.

"Sunscreen can be very damaging to the environment and not everybody knows," Zapata said.

Ingredients in everyday sunscreen can harm both coral reefs and local wildlife, according to the National Ocean Service. Look for a reef-safe sunscreen that lacks harmful ingredients like oxybenzone, octinoxate, nano titanium dioxide, and nano zinc oxide.

Where you stay matters, too

Abbey Lossing for Insider

Look into a hotel's claims about sustainability

Between countless certification programs and eco-friendly branding, experts agree that it can be tricky trying to evaluate whether or not a hotel is actually contributing to a destination.

When researching different accommodations, look for specifics beyond being "eco-friendly" and giving up plastic straws, Miller says. He suggests looking for hotels with written policies about how they work with local communities, prevent food waste, and help environmental initiatives like reforestation and supporting local dive sites.

If they don't have that information, Louise urges travelers to ask questions: "If they are authentically sustainable, they'll be excited to answer them."

Blotter encourages travelers to choose accommodation options that are upfront about their environmental efforts.

"Hotels that are truly eco-friendly should have a sustainability statement and clearly stated initiatives visible on their website," Blotter said. "While sustainability certifications are great and make it easier for travelers to identify sustainable lodging, not all hotels embracing eco-friendly practices will boast such certifications."

Blotter said to look for certifications from organizations that look into the foundation and practices of locations, businesses, and facilities to see if they meet their standards for sustainability and environmentalism. Some of these include the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Certified B Corporation, and Green Globe, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, and WELL Building Standard.

Although some certifications indicate a hotel is sustainable, Zapata and Miller said guests shouldn't book solely based on certifications since they can be costly for smaller resorts and hotels to acquire. "If they've made a commitment to the communities, to the destination, and they understand that they're part of the community that is what's important," Miller said.

Once you arrive, Zapata said guests should look for evidence that their accommodation is following the claims it makes. Speak to housekeeping staff, check in with chefs about the food they're serving, and see if you get new towels each morning — if you do, you could help save water by skipping this service.

Stay at mom-and-pop hotels and inns

Picking a locally owned bed-and-breakfast over an Airbnb or big hotel is going to have a more positive impact on the local community, some of the experts Insider spoke with said.

"Short-term Airbnb-type holiday rentals might feel convenient, but they're having a devastating impact on some popular destinations — pricing people out of their homes and wiping out whole communities," Francis said. "Consider opting instead for a local homestay, B&B or local-owned hotel."

Make smart decisions throughout your stay

Abbey Lossing for Insider

Use public transportation

If possible, experts suggest skipping a rental car. Instead, turn to the destination's public transportation.

"Don't discount your travel in the destination," Francis said. "Try and avoid internal flights, and consider ditching the private car or tour bus. There are loads of great human-powered, local-guided tours around — by foot, bike, or even kayak."

Eat local foods

Besides the flight to your destination, food waste will likely be the second-largest contributor to your vacation's carbon footprint, according to National Geographic.

"We traditionally don't think of sustainable tourism as something like, 'Oh, I can lay on the beach and have a cocktail, and that could have a positive impact on the world,'" Louise said. But if you think about where your food comes from and the story behind that, it can have a positive impact, she added.

That means seeking ingredients that are grown nearby instead of shipped across the country and checking to make sure restaurants are hiring locals and paying them fair wages. By evaluating restaurants on these items, you'll likely get "fresher and better foods that are unique to that destination," Louise said.

Seek off-the-beaten-path activities

Most experts agree that when it comes to exploring a destination, it's worth turning to locals for advice. That might mean joining a local Facebook group, sparking a conversation on a public bus, or finding a community-based tourism program.

"Look for ways to seek out local voices and to understand how they want their destination seen," Louise said. By talking to locals, you're likely to avoid contributing to over-tourism and have a more unique experience, she added.

Another way you can approach activities is by centering your plans around a cause you and your group care about, such as ocean conservation or LGBTQ rights, Louise said.

Once you've settled on a topic, look at how your actions and the activities you choose can support that cause. For example, you might eat at restaurants owned by diverse staff or seek voluntourism opportunities to protect a nearby beach.

Blotter recommends avoiding experiences that use animals as entertainment like elephant rides, and looking for charity-run activities instead.

When you're back from the activity, whether it was a volunteer job or a locally-recommended hike, Miller said travelers should "brag about it." He encourages people who are traveling responsibly to post about their experience and use word-of-mouth to inspire others.

Buy local

Pass on the manufactured magnets, mass-produced T-shirts, and generic keychains. Instead, Zapata said travelers should search for items that are unique and crafted by locals.

"If you're going to buy a memento, buy something that's actually made there," she said. That way you ensure the money spent on the souvenir is directly supporting the community.

While all of these decisions you make as an individual matter, Miller says that ultimately "the solution to everything is to get governments and major corporations to change and reduce their emissions period."

According to Miller, that's something travelers can do in the voting booth that can go a long way.

Better Me tips for sustainable living

Slide through the following cards to read more expert advice on sustainable living. Then check out the rest of the stories from Insider's Better Me series.
Over the past year, we’ve seen how a global crisis can bring travel to a sudden halt. Though the pandemic remains front of mind, there is another crisis that will bring even graver consequences for humanity and imperil the destinations we love. That threat is climate change.

In recent years, tourism came under heightened scrutiny for its contribution to the climate emergency. We began hearing terms like “flight shaming” as people became more aware of their impact. Tourism does play a role in the climate crisis, there’s no denying that. In fact, a 2018 study found that tourism accounts for 8% of the world’s carbon emissions. On this webpage we provide a breakdown of the different activities that contribute to tourism’s carbon footprint.

But this doesn’t mean you should swear off traveling altogether. The restart of tourism allows us to rethink our habits and learn how to travel in a responsible way. There are many ways that you can lessen your travel emissions and drive the industry towards a more sustainable future.

Read our tips below to discover how you can reduce the carbon footprint of your next trip!

1. Avoid flying to nearby destinations

Air travel and other forms of transportation comprise the largest portion of tourism’s carbon footprint. Did you know that taking just one flight can produce more emissions than some people produce in an entire year? Take for instance a round-trip flight from Chicago to London which produces roughly 2.2 metric tons of CO2 per passenger. That’s double the amount of emissions that the average person in Guatemala generates over an entire year.
Answer: Restricting travel to only nearby destinations to reduce emissions can be seen as a fair approach from an environmental perspective, as it aims to minimize the carbon footprint associated with long-distance travel, particularly air travel. However, it could have implications for the social sustainability of tourism, as it may limit cultural exchange, economic benefits for distant communities reliant on tourism, and personal freedom to explore diverse destinations.

To avoid compromising the social sustainability of tourism, several measures could be adopted:

1. **Promote Sustainable Tourism Practices Globally**: Encourage sustainable tourism practices in all destinations, regardless of distance. This includes supporting local economies, respecting cultural heritage, and minimizing environmental impact.

2. **Invest in Sustainable Transportation**: Develop and promote more sustainable transportation options, such as high-speed trains and electric vehicles, to make long-distance travel more environmentally friendly.

3. **Encourage Longer Stays**: Promote longer stays at destinations to reduce the frequency of travel and allow travelers to immerse themselves more deeply in the local culture and economy.

4. **Support Local Economies**: Encourage travelers to support local businesses and communities, ensuring that tourism dollars benefit the local population and contribute to social sustainability.

5. **Educate Travelers**: Raise awareness about the environmental and social impacts of travel, encouraging travelers to make informed decisions that balance their desire to explore with the need to protect the planet and support local communities.

By implementing these measures, it is possible to reduce the environmental impact of travel while maintaining the social and economic benefits that tourism can provide to communities around the world.

Answer: Restricting travel to only destinations close to one's home country to reduce emissions can be seen as a fair approach from an environmental perspective, as it aims to minimize the carbon footprint associated with long-distance travel. However, it could have implications for the social sustainability of tourism, particularly for destinations that rely heavily on international visitors for economic support.

To avoid compromising the social sustainability of tourism, several measures could be adopted:

1. **Promote Local Tourism**: Encourage domestic tourism to support local economies. This can be achieved by highlighting lesser-known attractions and experiences within the country.

2. **Diversify Tourism Offerings**: Destinations can diversify their tourism offerings to attract a broader range of visitors, including those interested in cultural, historical, or nature-based experiences.

3. **Develop Sustainable Tourism Infrastructure**: Invest in sustainable tourism infrastructure that can accommodate both local and international tourists in an environmentally friendly manner.

4. **Support Local Businesses**: Encourage tourists to support local businesses, artisans, and markets, which can help sustain the local economy even with fewer international visitors.

5. **Implement Sustainable Practices**: Encourage tourism operators to adopt sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy, reducing waste, and conserving water, to make tourism more sustainable overall.

6. **Educate Travelers**: Educate travelers about the importance of sustainable travel and how they can contribute positively to the destinations they visit.

By adopting these measures, the tourism industry can work towards balancing environmental goals with the need to support local communities and economies.

the best response is to separate them immediately. Each person should be interviewed separately and reminded of the company’s zero-tolerance policy prohibiting workplace violence, including verbal aggression.

Physical Altercations

The U.S. Department of Labor indicates that a supervisor should call for assistance and not intervene directly if a physical altercation happens at work. As per company procedures, along with assessing the risk of harm to individuals or property, the supervisor should call 911 or security personnel on duty.

If there is a risk to personal safety, such as the presence of a weapon, the supervisor should escort workers nearby to a safe location. Police will take over the situation when they arrive. Serious or repeated physical altercations may be grounds for immediate job termination of one or both employees involved in the conflict.

Company policies on discipline should strive for fairness by adhering to these criteria:

Develop clear, fair rules and consequences.

Clearly communicate policies.

Conduct a fair investigation.

Balance consistency with flexibility.

Use corrective action, not punishment.

When an employee must be disciplined, typically these steps are followed:

This perspective focuses on the micro-level interactions and the meanings that individuals attach to their social experiences. In the café, the baristas and patrons engage in a shared social environment where specific patterns of behavior, language, and interactions develop. These patterns can be seen as a form of social script or "language" that helps individuals navigate their roles and relationships within the café setting. The café becomes a microcosm of social life where people create and interpret symbols, such as the act of drinking coffee, which holds different meanings for different individuals.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================

Introduction

Most HIV-infected patients in resource-rich settings are successfully treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) [1–3]. However, up to two-thirds of these patients take a concomitant medication to mitigate ART side effects and/or to treat comorbid conditions [4–6]. Concomitant medication use is more prevalent in those with HIV than in the general population  and has been associated with older age, female sex, obesity and hepatitis B/C coinfection [4–7]. Concomitant medications could complicate HIV care by contributing to polypharmacy, interactions, side effects and suboptimal adherence.

Polypharmacy (commonly defined as use of five or more medications [8,9]) is associated with increased risk for morbidity, nonadherence, drug interactions and side effects in the general population [4,6,9,10], and is more common in HIV-infected adults than in the general population [4,11,12]. Polypharmacy increases with age [11,13], but is likely underestimated given that
 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91953-2

In our study, we identified a high frequency of DDIs between drugs for COVID-19 and concomitant drugs used during admissions. One third of the patients showed multiple 4 or more DDIs. In addition, a high rate of potential DDIs among treatments for COVID-19 and comedications prescribed as outpatients. The results obtained show that patients with COVID-19 have high comorbidity and polypharmacy rates, a circumstance that influences a greater likelihood of real DDIs to therapy for COVID-19.

To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to address the issue of drug interactions, highlighting the great safety concerns associated with the therapy available at the beginning of the pandemic. Keeping in mind that the age range of the patients most affected in the first wave of the pandemic were those of older age, the use of concomitant medication becomes especially relevant and it is worth highlighting even more the need to evaluate the possible interactions between the experimental
Answer: Concomitant medication refers to drugs that are taken simultaneously with other treatments, such as antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV or treatments for COVID-19, to manage side effects or treat comorbid conditions.

In contrast, past drugs would refer to medications that a patient has taken in the past but are not currently being used alongside the primary treatment. The key difference is that concomitant medications are actively being used at the same time as the primary treatment, whereas past drugs are not.

Answer: Concomitant medication refers to drugs that are taken simultaneously with other treatments, often to manage side effects or treat comorbid conditions. These medications are used alongside the primary treatment, such as antiretroviral therapy for HIV or treatments for COVID-19, and can lead to polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactions. In contrast, past drugs are medications that a patient has taken previously but are not currently being used in conjunction with their present treatment regimen.

Contrary to “exceptionalist” arguments that American culture was by nature always inhospitable to socialist and radical labor movements, the United States actually hosted the most vigorous efforts to build utopian-socialist colonies in modern history, the most violent class struggle of any industrializing society, and the world’s most influential utopian novel ever written.1 That was Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward, first published in and translated into dozens of foreign languages, reaching readers all over the world with an ardent anti-capitalist message and an image of a peaceful and prosperous order of collectivized economy sustained by a new religion of solidarity.2 To be sure, Bellamy called his ideal future order not “socialism” but “nationalism,” and the system that this future had succeeded was not named “capitalism” but described simply as the late world of greed, wealth, poverty, and toil. (Before the word “capitalism” came into common usage, the industrializing American economy of the had been described as “commercial society,” “the wages system,” or other terms.) Thus, calling early socialist critiques “anti-capitalist” amounts, strictly speaking, to anachronism. Nonetheless, for all intents and purposes (and using current-day terminology), anti-capitalist thought figured at least as a potent minority opinion of dissent in the American 1840s. Proudly giving their journal the forward-looking title, The Harbinger, US followers of Charles Fourier’s collectivist vision maintained a sharp polemical assault on the norms of bourgeois boosterism advanced by patriots such as Daniel Webster in the years following the country’s “market revolution.”3 Utopia was the name Thomas More gave to the imaginary distant island described in his volume of the same name: a Greek-derived term of dual meaning, suggesting both “no place” and “good place.” Consequently, “utopia” came to mean a form of writing that was one part fantasy and one part political discourse, the latter sketching what More in his subtitle called “the best form of commonwealth.”4 From the start, utopia could be rendered an adjective, alluding thus to the “utopian republic,” or in noun form to denote an inhabitant of this imagined place, a utopian. Much later, Marx and Engels applied the term to a number of speculative predecessors, the “utopian socialists” Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and Robert Owen, of whose achievements the writers of the Communist Manifesto were rather less censorious (and more appreciative) than they were reputed to be. Marx and Engels denied that their own communist politics pretended to the status of a “universal doctrine” or a “new social science” good for all times and places, as the early system-builders claimed; but they also acknowledged the “critical element” in that work which “attack[ed] every principle of existing society.” Marx and Engels noted too the “practical measures proposed” in those critiques, which sketched possible forms of a future classless society and thus reflected, the Manifesto judged, “the first instinctive yearnings of [the modern proletariat] for a general reconstruction of society.”5 In any case, the followers of the early utopians founded many actual “pilot communities,” as historian Carl Guarneri calls them, and thus the term applied not only to philosophical or literary texts but also to varied kinds of experimental settlements—connoting thereby a real social movement and not merely a figment of imagination. Communitarianism, understood as a program of multiplying such cooperative or collectivist settlements to prefigure a more general social transformation to come, faded after the late (without ever disappearing utterly) from the principal forms of labor-based socialist and communist politics in the United States. Later, the idea of utopia resurfaced in European and American discourse with the publication of Karl Mannheim’s Ideology and Utopia (in English translation, ), the two terms of the title meant to define fundamentally distinct modes of thought or consciousness, the first indicating idealized views of existing social order intended for conservative purposes to defend it and the second indicating idealized visions of the future that served to criticize or undermine present social forms. While several mid- critics argued that modern totalitarianism stemmed from furious attempts to realize utopian dreams—thereby suggesting the great danger of such imaginaries—the best-known critic of “ideologies” in the United States, sociologist Daniel Bell, hewed more to Mannheim’s meaning when he argued there remained a place for utopia as a form of social criticism and anticipations of a better world that could still generate meaningful political visions. At the turn of the , he responded to Francis Fukuyama’s notion of an “end of history,” signaled by the advent of global neoliberalism, by publishing an afterword to a reissue of The End of Ideology, entitled “The Resumption of History in the New Century,” while he worked on an unfinished book manuscript he called The Rebirth of Utopia. In the years immediately following Bell’s death in , a new literature by young writers shaken by the Great Recession of renewed anti-capitalist thought and the exploration of utopian alternatives.6

American Owenites and Fourierists Starting with Ann Lee’s Shakers in the 1770s, various strains of Christian millennialism sponsored cooperative American settlements before the classic utopians inspired secular communitarian visions among bands of reformers in the United States. The Scottish cotton manufacturer and philanthropist Robert Owen ( ) came to the United States to establish a base at New Harmony, Indiana, in , following the exit of the Christian Harmonists (followers of George Rapp) from that Wabash River town. Essentially a voluntary community devoted to Enlightenment ideals of scientific reason, modern child-centered (Pestalozzian) education, and social welfare, New Harmony never reached the stage of a full-fledged order of communal property that Owen had envisioned, and it collapsed due to internal dissension in . Owen’s disciple, Frances Wright ( ), attempted to apply Owenite principles to an interracial community at Nashoba, Tennessee as a means of gradual emancipation for enslaved black workers, but that failed too due to mismanagement and much more public hostility than New Harmony encountered. Thereafter, Wright had a short-lived career as a lecturer advocating free thought, equality for women, and workers’ rights (in collaboration with the New York Workingmen’s Party) before she was driven out of public life.7 It was Owen’s and Wright’s anticlericalism that won them their most vehement assailants; a decade further on, Fourierism—linked more to romantic Transcendentalism than to Enlightenment rationalism—gained a substantial body of followers in the United States and constituted (under the name Associationism) the first clearly utopian-communitarian ideological current to enter American political discourse. Its leading historian, Carl Guarneri, estimates 100,000 “followers” of Associationism—including inhabitants of Fourierist “phalanxes” and, in much greater numbers, members of Associationist clubs and their sympathizers. The French doctrinaire Charles Fourier ( ) had a genuine disciple in the American reformer Albert Brisbane ( ), who in turn had the support of the New York crusader journalist Horace Greeley ( ) and, by , the committed volunteers of Brook Farm led by preacher and organizer George Ripley ( ). For a brief time, as the Panic of and the ensuing economic depression spread disaffection from the business world’s norm of market individualism, hundreds of artisans, tradesmen, middle-class professionals, and enterprising pioneers flocked to communitarian settlements that offered hopes of prosperity, security, equality, and “society”—that is, cooperation and fellowship that promised an alternative to the cut-throat world of each-for-his-own. During the 1840s, cooperators formed some dozens of “phalanxes,” Fourier’s term for the collective organisms that would, in some federal fashion, create over time a worldwide network of self-sufficient groups.8 Fourier and his followers spoke less of capitalism than they did of “Civilization,” deemed in Rousseauan fashion a corrupt world of egoism, greed, luxury and penury, waste, inequality, and unfreedom—to be succeeded, ultimately, in the “New Order” of “Harmony.” If they didn’t know capitalism, Associationists certainly knew capitalists and the ravages of market competition, caustically analyzed and condemned in the penetrating but short-lived publication of the national Associationist movement, The Harbinger, which became in effect the first organ of left-wing anti-capitalist critique to appear in American society. Most of the phalanxes collapsed within a few years, if not sooner, due to factional divisions over matters of religion or policy, woefully inadequate starting resources, adverse market trends that undercut the value of the goods they hoped to sell to nearby towns and cities, and the resumption of economic growth at large that made other opportunities more attractive to restless settlers. As Guarneri points out, early enthusiasts expected the benefits of Association in greater prosperity and security to come quickly and too easily, leading to early disillusionment. More importantly, the model of the phalanx—based on investments by shareholders, differential distribution of proceeds to shareholders and non-shareholding (laboring) residents, and the sale of cooperatively produced goods in nearby markets—made the communities less a fully socialist alternative than a variant of business practice. Indeed, a political Whig like Greeley could imagine these ventures as a kind of profit-sharing corporation that could have a future in the scheme of American economic growth. Nonetheless, the pages of the Harbinger, skewering the oppression of “wage slavery,” the exploitative power of increasingly concentrated wealth, the susceptibility of the market to crisis, and more, demonstrated that utopian doctrine was more influential for the criticism it offered of existing society than for the futurist modeling it provided. A few phalanxes lasted long enough to show a number of adherents that cooperative labor was feasible and that cooperative residences (featuring a routine and vibrant sociability) offered a preferable alternative to the normative “isolated household” of Civilization.

Other Mid-19th-Century Communities Another response to disappointing phalanxes yielded an American brand of individualist anarchism that fostered a few libertarian colonies such as Josiah Warren’s Modern Times village, halfway across the span of Long Island, but they proved likewise ephemeral. In a very different vein, a few noted communal settlements founded on devout Christian principles enjoyed greater longevity. German pietists known as True Inspirationists settled in the Amana villages of central Iowa, maintaining communal property and production among several hundred believing families from the . In upstate New York, followers of the “Perfectionist” theologian and preacher John Humphrey Noyes ( ) built the Oneida Community to recreate the ancient communism of the earliest Christians, from . Oneidans also notoriously initiated a system of “complex marriage” based on free sexual relations, birth control, and (for about a decade) planned procreation according to Noyes’s proto-eugenicist scheme of “stirpiculture.” Despite several attempts by conservative journalists and clergymen to quash Oneida, the community maintained generally good relations with its neighbors. Admired for its orderly, productive, and highly cultured demeanor, it had become a tourist destination by the 1860s and 1870s. Noyes, notwithstanding his personal identification with Paul the Apostle, remained a recognized intellectual conversant with secular socialist theories and Darwinism. Yet another stream of frankly communist but largely secular settlers, followers of the French radical republican Étienne Cabet ( ), sought to build versions of “New Icaria,” modeled in Cabet’s utopian novel, Travels in Icaria, first in Texas and later in Illinois, Missouri, and California. In France, Cabet’s long career in anti-monarchical politics drew to him a much larger following than Fourier, but in the United States that order was reversed. Associationism was a full-fledged movement with American-born participants, while the Icarians remained largely a corps of French emigrants and their offspring, stumbling through several schisms and splits from . Amana and Oneida had more definite afterlives: almost as Horace Greeley may have imagined, when their residents voted to end communal property, the town enterprises reorganized as successful joint-stock companies. Oneida’s manufacturing expertise shifted from fur-hunting traps to cutlery, and Amana’s from fine woolens to (by the 1930s) refrigerators.

Beyond Associationism In the 1850s, the dissenting social movements of abolitionism and women’s rights eclipsed Associationism, though at least some of the proponents of those great mid-century campaigns briefly brushed shoulders with socialist ideas or practices. It was, after all, “free labor” (rather than common property and collective work) that stood as the principal antithesis of slavery. Nonetheless, a different kind of utopian alternative arose in scattered black homesteading communities that offered the promise of a refuge from white supremacy. Generally planned as concentrations of family-owned, subsistence farming plots (combined with common schools) for free blacks or refugees from slavery, many of these settlements depended on white benefactors and suffered from inadequate resources and poor management. The most successful, the Elgin settlement near Buxton, Ontario, welcomed fugitives, housed about a thousand people, and survived for nearly two decades; a significant number of Elgin settlers returned to the United States after the Union Army formed black regiments in . Another example, more utopian in its aspirations for moral regeneration, was based on a large land gift by abolitionist Gerrit Smith near Lake Placid in New York State, at North Elba, or “Timbucto” as its residents called it. There, some twenty or thirty black families dwelled, joined by John Brown, who believed the settlement could secede from the American culture of whiteness, escape the cut-throat world of commercial business, and serve as a base both for funneling fugitives to Canada and preparing an armed anti-slavery force to invade the South. In one of the most curious conjunctions in the history of American utopianism, two of John Brown’s co-conspirators were buried at the Associationist community of Raritan Bay, New Jersey after the Harpers Ferry raid was crushed. If, as historian Steven Hahn has suggested, places like Timbucto may be considered “maroon” settlements comparable to those rebellious havens of fugitive slaves elsewhere in the Americas, it would be possible also to regard the futurist imagination of black insurrection in the tradition begun by Martin R. Delany’s Blake; or, The Huts of America, published serially from , as a distinctive black utopian literary genre.9 Full-scale capitalist industrialization in the United States, from the 1870s through the 1890s, led to a utopian revival toward the end of the . Although also, like Associationism, linked to concrete social movements, this utopian surge took a more decidedly literary form and a more insistently anti-capitalist tenor. In contrast to Fourierist phalanxes that—due to their implantation in a growing market society not yet fully industrialized—remained quasi-capitalist even as they pioneered cooperative labor practices, the very imaginative scope of fiction writing permitted the presentation of a more thoroughgoing alternative to the existing order. In other words, utopian literature rather than utopian communities assumed the vanguard of radical critique. The standout in this field, of course, was Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward ( ), which evoked a sharp, transatlantic riposte in William Morris’s News from Nowhere ( ), which in turn would be cited in William Dean Howells’s A Traveler from Altruria ( )—a trend that issued after another twenty years in the feminist utopia, Herland ( ), by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, whose socialist-feminist career began in her support for Bellamy’s Nationalism.

Utopia Outlines the Horizon of Expectation However “visionary” Edward Bellamy’s portrait of Boston in the year was, he intended it as a plausible alternative to the order of his own day. At the very start of the novel, Bellamy announced the crucial critical function of utopian writing—that is, the intent to challenge the hold of the present on the political imagination and thereby to awaken “daring anticipations of human development.” The book’s preamble introduced the “romantic narrative” of time-traveler Julian West as a mere pedagogical device adopted by a historian in aiming to survey a century’s progress since the time when Americans mistakenly held “the general belief that the ancient industrial system, with all its shocking social consequences, was destined to last, with possibly a little patching, to the end of time.”10 Indeed, in a Postscript included in most subsequent editions of the novel, Bellamy answered a critic who doubted a mere century’s progress could realize the harmonious order depicted therein: he had intended Looking Backward, Bellamy wrote, as “a work of realistic imagination,” a “forecast . . . of the next stage in the industrial and social development of humanity,” composed “in the belief that the Golden Age lies before us and not behind us, and is not far away.”11 In the novel, Julian West, having slept away a century in his self-designed sensory-deprivation chamber, recalled society of the 1880s in the image of “a prodigious coach which the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged [by rope] toilsomely along a very hilly and sandy road,” driven by hunger, while a small elite of passengers rode aloft, insecure in their perch but determined to save their seats for their offspring and possessed by the “singular hallucination . . . that they were not exactly like their brothers and sisters who pulled at the rope, but of finer clay.”12 This image of inequality and “incredible inhumanity” has endured as a classic trope of anti-capitalist polemic and established all the terms that the utopian future would negate. Above all, the new economy of the year —organized as one great enterprise under the authority of the people of the United States—offered all an equal share of the nation’s wealth in the form of an annual allotment, a single credit card in effect, on the basis of which each citizen was free to obtain desired goods from an efficient order-and-delivery system of public warehouses. “His title [to that share] is his humanity,” Julian’s Boston host Dr. Leete explains. Thus “equality of condition” was established, a great principle joined with the other watchwords of the French revolution, liberty and fraternity—or the “mutual benevolence and disinterestedness” among citizens secured by faith in the “solidarity of humanity.” Corresponding ethics of obligation and responsibility mustered all citizens into the nation’s “industrial army,” from the age of majority to midlife (age 45), based on the free choice of occupation and public training; service and excellence was motivated by “emulation,” advancement through ranks, and public honors, not by differential monetary rewards. Dr. Leete’s instruction includes, as a famous illustration, his note of the public awnings that extended over Boston’s streets as weather demanded: “The difference between the age of individualism and that of concert,” he explains, is “well characterized by the fact that, in the , when it rained, the people of Boston put up three hundred thousand umbrellas over as many heads, and in the they put up one umbrella over all the heads.”13 Nurtured by his growing love of Dr. Leete’s daughter Edith, Julian—who was steadily drawn, like most utopian protagonists, from skepticism to conversion—concludes at one point: If I were asked to name the most distinguishing felicity of this age . . . I should say that to me it seems to consist in the dignity you have given to labor by refusing to set a price upon it and abolishing the marketplace forever. By requiring of every man his best you have made God his task master, and by making honor the sole reward of achievement, you have imparted to all service the distinction peculiar in my day to the soldier’s. Indeed, at one point Julian restates the triple standard of liberty, equality, and fraternity as the virtues “order, equity, and felicity” that Boston had attained.14 Rather little is said about the status of women aside from their service in a separate corps of the industrial army, the fact that marriage is governed by love not money, and that public, cooperative kitchens and laundries freed women from household drudgery. Otherwise, the masculine prerogative and genteel sexual norms of Bellamy’s day seem to prevail in his utopian future. Generally, both Edith and Dr. Leete repeatedly assert that individuals have greater, not lesser freedom of choice in the year , though Bellamy’s emphasis on discipline and obligation—along with absence of democratic procedures (signaled by a suffrage restricted to retired members of the industrial army)—have long led critics to view his system as one of “authoritarian socialism.” To be sure, Bellamy saw most functions of government to be administrative, guided by appointed managers, but the real keynote is not authoritarian control but a trend (due to efficiency) toward reducing the scope of government and hence of the corrupt politics of his day. Importantly, Bellamy’s system is never, in the novel, described as “control” by the state but rather control by the nation, which he clearly understood as “the people” who, Dr. Leete says, “concluded [at the turn of the ] to assume the conduct of their own business, just as one hundred-odd years before they had assumed the conduct of their own government.” Hence, Bellamy termed his system “Nationalism,” not socialism.15 William Morris’s critique targeted the element of order and control in Bellamy’s vision not on the basis of democratic governance (for matters of governance are as invisible in News from Nowhere as they are in Looking Backward) but on Morris’s resistance to centralized industry. In Morris’s reading of Marx, indebted also to John Ruskin’s esthetics, it is the degradation of work under industrial capitalism as well as poverty and bourgeois oppression that figure as the chief evils of the old order. In striking contrast to Looking Backward (for there, the “partisans of the red flag” played no role in what amounted to a moral awakening of all classes to the “national” cause), Morris details the turmoil of a revolutionary struggle that ushered in the post-capitalist way of life, one which is far more pastoral than Bellamy’s Boston. The division of city and country has been dismantled, and advanced technology, though not entirely absent, plays very little role compared to individual crafts and voluntary collective labor, primarily agrarian in character. Goods are for the taking in shops; services are provided as neighborly beneficence; abundance is assured largely due to the avoidance of the waste that was built into the manufactured needs of the capitalist marketplace and the superfluous labors of money-getting. While heterosexual romance plays a role too in Morris’s narrative, he offers some hints of greater sexual autonomy for women and more relaxed erotic lives than anything suggested in Bellamy. While the time traveler in News from Nowhere disappears from England-of-the-future at the novel’s end—presumably awakening from his midsummer night’s dream—Morris derided Looking Backward as a “cockney dream,” the term referring not to the East End poor but rather the pampered nouveau riche of his time, probably meaning thereby to sneer at the leisured upper-middle-class aura of the Leete household. Nonetheless, the Nationalist movement that organized after publication of Looking Backward had sympathy for, and a significant ideological impact on, the Populists of the 1890s, or at least on those Populists who imagined the cooperative commonwealth as a radically new system (as opposed to merely a rationale for producers’ cooperatives as a niche component within the capitalist market). Among Bellamy’s followers was Charlotte Perkins Gilman, for whom the collective kitchens and laundries of Looking Backward would play an important part of her argument, in Women and Economics ( ), for why socialism could liberate women. In Gilman’s novel, Herland ( ), she went further in imagining an entirely female parthenogenetic society that constituted a utopia of common care. Contrasting an ethos of “solidarity” and “social service” to ideas of competition, mastery, and conquest, Gilman’s portrait of Herland betrayed her origin in Bellamyite Nationalism, though here the “religion of solidarity” appeared as the “sacrament” of Motherhood in which childbirth was followed by collective child-rearing. If the unexamined masculinism of most utopias qualifies their claims to universalistic principles, the signs of Gilman’s eugenic racialism (presenting the denizens of Herland as a “pure stock”) do the same in this novel.16 (Herland was preceded by a more obscure newspaper serial in , Mizora, by Mary E. Bradley Lane, where an all-female society reproduces by parthenogenesis and the theme of racial—Aryan—purity also prevails.)17 The keynote of Herland, however, is Gilman’s mockery of androcentric views and assumptions. When the most macho of the male interlopers in Herland insists that without competition there would be no “stimulus to industry”—because “no man would work unless he has to”—his native interlocutor exclaims, “Oh, no man! You mean that is [another] one of your sex distinctions?”18 With less attention than Bellamy to the workings of production and distribution in a future order of life, Herland maximized that element of utopian writing devoted to the critique, by counterposition, of current norms—in this case, the very idea of sex-linked traits that depicted American women as by nature dependent, uncreative, “catty,” and sexually “available” to men. The Nationalist Clubs that appeared right after publication of Looking Backward, starting with Boston’s chapter in , spread across the country; over 150 such clubs by drew a mostly middle-class membership rallying around a political platform calling for government ownership of mines, railroads, and telephone and telegraph—which jibed with the People’s Party platform of .19 William Dean Howells belonged to the Boston club; his own utopia, A Traveler from Altruria, introduced a twist in the conventional form by setting the story in existing American society and making the protagonist a visitor from a distant egalitarian, collectivist society who is scandalized by the hierarchical, anti-democratic practices in the United States; the traveler finds his most sympathetic audience among plebeian farmers and craftsmen of the countryside who live a more or less impoverished life beyond the confines of the bourgeois resort hotel that hosts his visit. While Nationalism faded as an organized movement rather quickly, the years that followed, into the early decades of the , witnessed the founding of communitarian settlements, either socialist or anarchist by conviction, around the country. Advocates of colonization included Julius Wayland, editor of the socialist Appeal to Reason in Girard, Kansas, and some members of Eugene Debs’s Social Democracy of America (SDA), organized in following the suppression of Debs’s American Railway Union and disappointment over the decline of Populism. Colonizers launched a few dozen ventures, mainly in the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest. Founders of the Equality colony in Edison, Washington, and Brotherhood in Burley, Washington, believed their efforts would make the entire state a socialist stronghold. Established as cooperatively run industrial settlements engaged in logging, sawmills, shingle making, and cigar making, Equality and the Burley community each engaged about a hundred residents and lasted about ten years. In southern California, a group led by Los Angeles socialist Job Harriman established a self-sufficient agricultural community named Llano del Rio in , with over 1,000 residents; moving to Louisiana in and building there a sawmill, broom factory, and other enterprises, Llano lasted until .20 Among anarchist settlements, the colony at Stelton, New Jersey grew out of the Francisco Ferrer Association (named for the radical Spanish freethinker executed under martial law in ) in and survived as a community of small landowners supporting the libertarian Ferrer Modern School in their midst until . Aside from a measure of mutual aid, Stelton never organized any sort of collective industry; besides the School, it became mainly a residential haven for assorted leftists (including communists by the 1930s) engaged in radical cultural institutions.21

Anti-Utopian Hiatus In various ways, the trauma of World War I and the revolutionary and reactionary movements that emerged from it dampened the speculative, progress-oriented spirit of the utopian impulse. The young social and cultural critic Lewis Mumford ( ) published The Story of Utopias in , suggesting that the “classic” tradition from Plato’s Republic and Thomas More to his own time had now run its course. He recognized contrary strains in the moment, citing “the atmosphere of disillusion which we breathe today” even as he claimed as justification for his survey that “it is only after the storm that we dare to look for the rainbow.” Disappointed by the doctrinaire or mechanistic notions he saw in Cabet or Bellamy, yet honoring attempts to envision the good life, Mumford concluded: “This is the first step out of the present impasse: we must return to the real world, and face it, and survey it in its complicated totality. Our castles-in-the air must have their foundations in solid ground.”22 Although Mumford was not an admirer, the Russian Revolution, the creation of the Soviet Union, and the founding of the Communist International played some role in converting erstwhile utopian energies into what appeared to socialist militants as “real politics”; not a few Americans journeyed to Russia starting in the early 1920s to join communal settlements featuring collective housekeeping and even, for a time, ideas of sexual liberation. The degeneration of the Soviet revolution, combined with the ferocity of Europe’s fascist movements and more general fears of modern mass society, fostered a new dystopian genre, from Evgeny Zamyatin’s We ( ) to Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World ( ) and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four ( ). The Great Depression and the approach of World War II failed to produce many hopeful visions beyond the fighting spirit of anti-fascism; one exception was the pallid utopian novel, The First to Awaken, ( ), published by the critic Granville Hicks about a cryogenically suspended New Englander revived a hundred years later in a modernistic, collectivist America of . Immediately following World War II, the most widespread aspirational vision of the future involved hopes for some kind of world government (to restrain future wars) rather than explicitly anti-capitalist visions. Nonetheless, an attempted rebirth of utopian communalism emerged very tentatively in the late 1940s precisely among circles of the disenchanted left that recoiled from the centralized, warfare state. When the journalist Dwight Macdonald, editor of the little magazine politics, sought to break from ideas of technological progress he associated with both Marxism and liberalism, he argued that the true “Radical” spirit could best thrive in small-scale, decentralized communities. Politics featured a number of attempts to re-invoke the classic utopians (Owen, Fourier, and others) against the “scientific socialism” that was marred by association with the Soviet Union and an untrustworthy Communist Party. In practical terms, Macdonald’s neo-utopianism was associated with moves by anarcho-pacifists such as David Dellinger to set up communal settlements—part retreat from the warfare state and part training ground for what would later emerge in the mid-1950s as the exemplary peacemaker tactics of the Committee for Non-Violent Action. The literary exemplars of this period were few—most notably Paul and Percival Goodman’s underappreciated Communitas ( ) and B. F. Skinner’s controversial Walden Two ( ). In Communitas, something like a manual for radical urban planners, the Goodmans eschewed the utopian dreamer’s great fault—a single, fixed model of perfection. Instead, they offered three distinct possible models of community planning, the first clearly based on contemporary consumer capitalism and disfavored by the authors—a hyper-centralized system demonstrating “how men can be as efficiently wasteful as possible”—and two others motivated by anti-capitalist values of pleasurable (craft-like) work, workers’ control, small-scale cooperation, the integration of country and city, and the proximity of home life and the public square, all to be achieved (so as not to be confused with the medievalism of William Morris) with “modern technology, a national economy, and a democratic society.”23 In contrast, Skinner’s Walden Two hewed to the one best way, a definite scheme for organizing social life by a sort of “behavioral engineering” that seemingly transposed F. W. Taylor’s principles of scientific management to the sphere of social interaction. The novel’s traveler, psychologist Professor Burris, visits his former student, T. E. Frazier, who has applied principles of operant conditioning by positive reinforcement to create a productive community based on common property, labor averaging four hours a day per member to fulfill most subsistence needs, collective child-rearing, and virtually unrestricted personal choice in leisure and creative, artistic pursuits—all operating according to norms and rules designed experimentally (and hence revisable) by Frazier to inculcate non-competitive, cooperative behavior. The two key figures, Burris and Frazier, represent different sides of Skinner himself (whose initials stood for Burrhus Frederick), and like other modern utopians, he quite seriously intended his imagined settlement as a prototype of real communities. Although Skinner believed his behaviorist idyll followed Thoreau’s ideas of an alternative mode of simple living, Life magazine—evoking the postwar sense that grand visions veiled totalitarian impulses—derided the comparison: “Thoreau’s book is profoundly antiutopian; it does not belong in the long line of antiseptic literature that began with Plato’s Republic. Far from trying to escape into a ‘brave new world,’ Thoreau, the cosmic bum, set out resolutely to make the best of what he could right around home.”24 The critic’s praise of the “antiutopian” disposition more accurately captured the spirit of the time than Skinner had.

Utopian Rebirth 1.0 A genuine rebirth of utopianism awaited the recharging of militant political opposition in the 1960s, which revived a vigorous critique of capitalism by the middle and late years of the decade, spurred (like the 1840s) by a spirit of “come-outerism” that yielded a wide variety of “intentional communities.” Many of these arose from a countercultural drive “back to the land,” where rural resettlement could model simplicity outside the modern consumer market, as promoted by long-time socialists Scott Nearing ( ) and Helen Nearing ( ) in Living the Good Life: How to Live Sanely and Simply in a Troubled World ( )—or create do-it-yourself futuristic dwellings like the solar homes of Drop City, Colorado.25 A new surge of imaginative writing about alternative futures also ran roughly from . The revival of protest in the late 1950s around the causes of the black freedom struggle and the anti-nuclear peace movement was complemented by a new “scientific-technological revolution,” which many observers thought implied the potential for massive gains in productivity. In , the so-called Triple Revolution Manifesto, signed by liberals, radicals, and socialists, forecast a rush of “automation” or “cybernation” that promised material abundance—but at the cost of mass unemployment, unless social reform dramatically reduced the standard work week and provided a basic income to all as a citizenship right. The very possibility of cornucopia led the Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse to declare “the end of utopia”; that is, he wrote, “the refutation of those ideas and theories that use the concept of utopia [i.e., as an unrealizable dream] to denounce certain socio-historical possibilities.’” Now, Marcuse claimed, complete automation made possible “the abolition of poverty and misery . . . of alienation and the abolition of what I have called ‘surplus repression,’” even as “the genesis and development of a vital need for freedom” had already appeared, inchoate, in countercultural dissent. In this argument, Marcuse’s declaration of “the end of utopia” made him, in Fredric Jameson’s words, “surely the most influential Utopian of the 1960s.”26 Marcuse was far from alone. The flourishing of radical feminism, environmentalism, and other “new social movements” provided new resources of imagination to utopian literature after . Much as Paul and Percival Goodman had sketched the terms of wedding “means of livelihood and [communal] ways of life,” the young radical feminist Shulamith Firestone concluded her manifesto of feminist revolution, The Dialectic of Sex ( ), by suggesting new means of constituting “households” in a future genderless society that would liberate women and children from age-old male domination. She built on Marcusean themes of “cybernated socialism” combined with the emancipation of eros. She foresaw the reduction of necessary labor to an absolute minimum and the common provision of subsistence; the practice of large groups (twelve to fifteen individuals) sharing housework or availing themselves of public kitchens and laundries; and adequate provisions for privacy and freedom so individuals could engage in “healthily selfish” creative pursuits in arts and sciences. She offered “some ‘dangerously utopian’ concrete proposals” intended to free women from the sole life-defining purpose of child-bearing, to free children in turn from possessive adults who see them as “extension[s] of ego,” and to diffuse child-rearing (or “intimate interaction with children”) through all of social life. Calling above all for “flexibility” in forms of individual or group living, she envisioned voluntarily formed “reproductive households” licensed as a group to tend young children “only for a given period . . . [socially] decided on as the minimal time in which children needed a stable structure in which to grow up—but probably a much shorter period than we now imagine.” Thereafter, the nurturing associations of young and old “might become lifelong attachments in which the individuals concerned mutually agreed to stay together . . . based on love alone, uncorrupted by dependencies and resulting class [including “sex-class”] inequalities.”27 Despite Firestone’s insistence on pushing technological development to the maximum (in fully artificial reproduction), she claimed “the best new currents in ecology and social planning agree with feminist aims”; in a world beyond sex dualism, she foresaw “a new equilibrium” between humans and their (already modified) environment. In fiction writing, new utopias indeed combined feminism and ecology in varying ways. The motif of utopian distance would now be represented by space travel (in works of Ursula Le Guin and Samuel R. Delany), time travel (in Marge Piercy’s Woman on the Edge of Time), or by political rupture, as in Ernest Callenbach’s depiction in Ecotopia ( ) of the Pacific Northwest as a secessionist state quarantined from (and thus unknown by) the rest of the United States for 20 years—until the novel’s traveler and protagonist, William Weston, ventures to document his pioneering tour of this terra incognita for American newspaper readers. Le Guin’s utopianism was always self-consciously “ambiguous” in that her imagined worlds do not represent any sort of perfection but instead play upon certain “thought experiments.” In The Left Hand of Darkness ( ), that experiment entails a vision of “ambisexual” humans who possess neither male nor female sexual identities—becoming temporarily one or another during a monthly period of heat—and who have no inclination to war. In an alternative vision of genderlessness, Piercy’s Woman on the Edge of Time ( ) depicted a future agrarian, communal society in which (as in Firestone) artificial reproduction produces children who are nurtured for a limited period of time by groups of adults of either sex. Le Guin’s The Dispossessed ( ) returned to older anti-capitalist themes, depicting the contrast between a property-less anarchism on the planet Anarres, populated by self-exiled dissenters from the dominant capitalist order of the planet Urras. The novel’s traveler and protagonist, the Anarresti scientist named Shevek, travels to Urras because the collective labor on Anarres prevents him from pursuing his scientific work—only to find the possessive individualism, sexual repression, and masculine hierarchy of Urras intolerable, prompting his return home. The science fiction, Triton ( ), by the gay African American writer Samuel R. Delany, takes Le Guin’s ambiguity further in describing a money-less society in which skin color means little, living quarters are available to all according to various permutations of sexual preference, bodily sexual reassignment is easily done (and reversible), men can arrange to suckle infants, and in what appears to be a satire of 1960s counterculture, Triton’s constitution makes “the subjective reality of each of its citizens as politically inviolable as possible.”28 Alas, Triton also engages in interplanetary cyberwar which destroys 5 million lives on another moon, an atrocity that makes little impact on the subjective reality of many Triton inhabitants. Callenbach’s Ecotopia is a more typical utopian novel in describing a desirable order of life founded on environmental sustainability (and drastically ratcheting down consumerist desires), one that overcomes, in time, the initial doubts and suspicions of the traveler and protagonist William Weston. Possessing something like a socialist mixed economy in which goods and services, beyond the universal provision assured by government, can be produced (mostly by cooperatives) and exchanged for money, Ecotopia has reduced the division of city and country, eliminated fossil fuels and worked the great trick of developing a moldable plastic entirely from vegetable sources, conquered to a large extent sexual jealousy in a regime of free love, and made government both accessible and reasonably transparent—all under the great pressures of an initial secessionist war and the persistence of counterrevolutionary conspirators keen to restore competitive capital accumulation. The surge of utopian revival after , however, rather quickly dried up as the world economy entered its “long downturn” in the middle of the 1970s, yielding by the 1980s a resurrection of free-market dogmas, and by the 1990s a widespread conviction that, in the words of Margaret Thatcher, “there is no alternative” to the capitalist market—in other words, the seeming end of utopia in precisely the opposite of Marcuse’s sense. It would take another historical shock, the Great Recession of , to jump-start the rebirth of utopia, version 2.0.

Rebirth of Utopia 2.0 It was Karl Mannheim’s contribution to suggest that “ideology” and “utopia” were complementary terms, both posing ideal visions of social reality—the first for the purpose of celebrating and fixing the status quo, the second for the purpose of stimulating efforts to go beyond it. Talk of “globalization” in the 1990s by and large fit the former mold, hailing a one-world marketplace promising to end poverty by making trade more fluid, liberating information and knowledge through digital communications, and building peace by the spread of cosmopolitan values the world over. It was not until after the Great Recession that empirical evidence of financial disarray, crushing austerity policies in many countries, mounting inequality, and acute strains within the “Western” bloc—all taken together—soundly refuted the global ideology of growth and prosperity, leading to a striking revival, primarily in intellectual rather than policy terms, of anti-capitalist critique. Starting around in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States and the anti-austerity popular mobilization stretching from Greece to Spain, a stream of new books appeared with titles such as Does Capitalism Have a Future?, How Will Capitalism End?, Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work, and Four Futures: Visions of the World After Capitalism. The liberal Nation magazine devoted a special issue to the theme of getting “out from under capitalism.”29 An influential and representative volume of this stripe, Paul Mason’s Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our Future ( ), argued that the realm of “info-tech,” the range of digital technologies based on the widespread sharing of information resources, spelled the death knell of the profit motive and capitalist growth. Echoing the cybernation visions of the 1960s, and like the authors of Inventing the Future, Mason also forecast massive, productivity-induced job displacement that made the drastic reduction in the general workweek (and the severing of income distribution from labor) urgent and imminent. Thus, the standard utopian feature of minimizing necessary labor was now virtually upon us, no longer utopian in the sense of far off and unrealistic. At the same time, however, Mason’s easy confidence that the egalitarian sharing economy of info-savvy individuals was already immanent in the lifeways of Occupy demonstrators signaled a utopian disposition to put a dream (i.e., wish fulfillment) in place of politics. How to get from “here” to “there,” from crisis-ridden capitalism to post-capitalism, drew no serious attention. Amid this flurry of renewed, future-oriented anti-capitalist thought, the literary theorist and long-time analyst of the utopian form, Fredric Jameson, presented his own contribution to the tradition, An American Utopia: Dual Power and the Universal Army ( ). Jameson had long bemoaned the absence of viable, action-oriented socialist visions in his time; “even the remarkable revival and new efflorescence of Marxian analysis of capitalism and its contradictions,” he wrote, “remains oddly fixated on an impossible present without any visible historical future, save catastrophe.” In that context, what was needed above all was the “stimulation of speculative images of the future and of perspectives of social change and alternate societies, something which now and for the moment only takes place under the banner of utopianism.”30 Jameson conceived of “dual power” as the more practical, “political” program wedded to a speculative “utopian proposal”—but even his “program” required a vast leap of imagination. Under the rubric of dual power, Jameson sought to identify a vehicle for organizing civil society into a collective institution that could coexist with and ultimately sap the power of the capitalist state, and this was to be what he called “the universal army.” Jameson defined the universal army as the conscription of all adult citizens into something like National Guard reserve units set to work, averaging a daily three or four hours, in performing all the necessary labor for social reproduction, wedded to the general provision of subsistence via a “guaranteed annual wage” and permitting unbounded free individual choice of activity (or leisure) in all other hours. Jameson’s proposal was, he made clear, a “thought experiment,” as Ursula Le Guin may have put it: on his “practical” side, he wished to locate an institution of current society that could serve as the incubus of collectivity in a way that the old union movement, the ethics of the learned professions, or religious community no longer could. He harked back to one of the old claims by radicals, ranging from the Fabians to Lenin, that the postal service stood as a model of socialist society—not, in Jameson’s view, an indication of their dry, administrative lack of imagination but rather as a meaningful allusion to some kind of social form that drew individuals and groups into fluent communication and interaction across differences. Thus the US Army or National Guard reserves came to mind, he suggested, not as military force as such but rather as the sole American institution that provided, in effect, “socialized medicine” (albeit in poor condition due to underfunding); that is, a public guarantee of free health care to all veterans. Think, Jameson said, of drafting all citizens and discharging them within a day, thereby granting them all health security! More than that, military service in the United States had served as a vehicle for rather rapid decision and social reform (i.e., desegregation after ) and (as for the millions of service members in World War II) the means of association across all sorts of social, cultural, and geographical distinctions, an “experience of social promiscuity” that provided a “first glimpse of a classless society.”31 The use of army units and reserves in disaster relief or the nation-building role of the Corps of Engineers illustrated the capacity of this collectivity to fulfill broad social functions that presumptively transcended special regional or vested interests. As suggested by other critics of the existing all-volunteer army and of endless war in our time, the flip side of the discipline required by service was the social check that the citizenry (the “nation in arms,” so to speak) could exercise on arbitrary actions of the state. Moreover, as a universal army, this institution would become the organ of civil society itself, by definition a “non-state” actor. In Jameson’s mind, the universal army was “a kind of network or exoskeleton of the social needs and functions”—though he invited his critics to propose other extant models of social interaction and collectivity that could play the same role.32 In some ways, Jameson returned to the origins of American anti-capitalist utopias, for his universal army clearly evoked Bellamy’s “industrial army” that organized all production and distribution in Dr. Leete’s Boston—and Jameson explicitly sought (in his more utopian mode) to recall Fourier, whose “calculus of passions” could be deployed to put individuals’ varying temperaments to work in ways satisfying both collective needs and individual desires. In the furthest reaches of his utopian fancy, Jameson speculated about how such a money-free society of collectivity, coordination, and a growing “realm of freedom” beyond the “realm of necessity” (in army service) would cope with resentments, by groups and individuals, of others—something he regarded as an ineradicable psychological fact of human behavior. Relying on notions of art as a “negative” critical force (borrowed from Marcuse and Theodor Adorno), he imagined that cultural creativity would be the vehicle of dissatisfaction, of the inevitable “grumbling” that was indeed necessary to check and harry the efficiency of bureaucracy, itself an unavoidable feature of social coordination. Like earlier utopians as well, Jameson thought the universal army—that “network or exoskeleton” of social needs and satisfaction—would overtake and finally eliminate the “state” as that center of coordination that was tied to a special monopoly of armed force. To be sure, Jameson held that his speculative utopia (as “nowhere”) was nonetheless realistic for refusing to imagine the disappearance of the “realm of necessity” or the psychic sources of unhappiness: this post-capitalist order would not be paradise. In any case, in Jameson’s work, the real dilemma of utopia remained: how would the salutary work of utopian imagination—opening a vista to alternative futures, awakening aspiration, and thus stirring the impulse to action—touch on the crucial mediation between here and there, the realm of strategy and tactics that could render transformational social visions practical? Jameson’s purpose in writing An American Utopia was, he said, to “rekindle the possibility of imagining future praxis.” Perhaps “rekindling the possibility” is enough, and the actual determination of future praxis is where utopia leaves off.33
Answer: The provided context does not specifically address methods of crowd control in Japanese anti-utopian literature or compare them to models presented in Western literature. The context primarily discusses the history and development of utopian and dystopian literature, focusing on Western authors and movements. Therefore, it does not provide information on the representation of crowd control methods in Japanese anti-utopian literature or how they might differ from Western models.

(Before the word “capitalism” came into common usage, the industrializing American economy of the had been described as “commercial society,” “the wages system,” or other terms.) Thus, calling early socialist critiques “anti-capitalist” amounts, strictly speaking, to anachronism. Nonetheless, for all intents and purposes (and using current-day terminology), anti-capitalist thought figured at least as a potent minority opinion of dissent in the American 1840s. Proudly giving their journal the forward-looking title, The Harbinger, US followers of Charles Fourier’s collectivist vision maintained a sharp polemical assault on the norms of bourgeois boosterism advanced by patriots such as Daniel Webster in the years following the country’s “market revolution.”3 Utopia was the name Thomas More gave to the imaginary distant island described in his volume of the same name: a Greek-derived term of dual meaning, suggesting both “no place” and “good place.” Consequently, “utopia” came to mean a form of writing that was one part fantasy and one part political discourse, the latter sketching what More in his subtitle called “the best form of commonwealth.”4 From the start, utopia could be rendered an adjective, alluding thus to the “utopian republic,” or in noun form to denote an inhabitant of this imagined place, a utopian. Much later, Marx and Engels applied the term to a number of speculative predecessors, the “utopian socialists” Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and Robert Owen, of whose achievements the writers of the Communist Manifesto were rather less censorious (and more appreciative) than they were reputed to be. Marx and Engels denied that their own communist politics pretended to the status of a “universal doctrine” or a “new social science” good for all times and places, as the early system-builders claimed; but they also acknowledged the “critical element” in that work which “attack[ed] every principle of existing society.” Marx and Engels noted too the “practical measures proposed” in those critiques, which sketched possible forms of a future classless society and thus reflected, the Manifesto judged, “the first instinctive yearnings of [the modern proletariat] for a general reconstruction of society.”5 In any case, the followers of the early utopians founded many actual “pilot communities,” as historian Carl Guarneri calls them, and thus the term applied not only to philosophical or literary texts but also to varied kinds of experimental settlements—connoting thereby a real social movement and not merely a figment of imagination. Communitarianism, understood as a program of multiplying such cooperative or collectivist settlements to prefigure a more general social transformation to come, faded after the late (without ever disappearing utterly) from the principal forms of labor-based socialist and communist politics in the United States. Later, the idea of utopia resurfaced in European and American discourse with the publication of Karl Mannheim’s Ideology and Utopia (in English translation, ), the two terms of the title meant to define fundamentally distinct modes of thought or consciousness, the first indicating idealized views of existing social order intended for conservative purposes to defend it and the second indicating idealized visions of the future that served to criticize or undermine present social forms. While several mid- critics argued that modern totalitarianism stemmed from furious attempts to realize utopian dreams—thereby suggesting the great danger of such imaginaries—the best-known critic of “ideologies” in the United States, sociologist Daniel Bell, hewed more to Mannheim’s meaning when he argued there remained a place for utopia as a form of social criticism and anticipations of a better world that could still generate meaningful political visions. At the turn of the , he responded to Francis Fukuyama’s notion of an “end of history,” signaled by the advent of global neoliberalism, by publishing an afterword to a reissue of The End of Ideology, entitled “The Resumption of History in the New Century,” while he worked on an unfinished book manuscript he called The Rebirth of Utopia. In the years immediately following Bell’s death in , a new literature by young writers shaken by the Great Recession of renewed anti-capitalist thought and the exploration of utopian alternatives.6\\n\\nAmerican Owenites and Fourierists Starting with Ann Lee’s Shakers in the 1770s, various strains of Christian millennialism sponsored cooperative American settlements before the classic utopians inspired secular communitarian visions among bands of reformers in the United States. The Scottish cotton manufacturer and philanthropist Robert Owen ( ) came to the United States to establish a base at New Harmony, Indiana, in , following the exit of the Christian Harmonists (followers of George Rapp) from that Wabash River town. Essentially a voluntary community devoted to Enlightenment ideals of scientific reason, modern child-centered (Pestalozzian) education, and social welfare, New Harmony never reached the stage of a full-fledged order of communal property that Owen had envisioned, and it collapsed due to internal dissension in . Owen’s disciple, Frances Wright ( ), attempted to apply Owenite principles to an interracial community at Nashoba, Tennessee as a means of gradual emancipation for enslaved black workers, but that failed too due to mismanagement and much more public hostility than New Harmony encountered. Thereafter, Wright had a short-lived career as a lecturer advocating free thought, equality for women, and workers’ rights (in collaboration with the New York Workingmen’s Party) before she was driven out of public life.7 It was Owen’s and Wright’s anticlericalism that won them their most vehement assailants; a decade further on, Fourierism—linked more to romantic Transcendentalism than to Enlightenment rationalism—gained a substantial body of followers in the United States and constituted (under the name Associationism) the first clearly utopian-communitarian ideological current to enter American political discourse. Its leading historian, Carl Guarneri, estimates 100,000 “followers” of Associationism—including inhabitants of Fourierist “phalanxes” and, in much greater numbers, members of Associationist clubs and their sympathizers. The French doctrinaire Charles Fourier ( ) had a genuine disciple in the American reformer Albert Brisbane ( ), who in turn had the support of the New York crusader journalist Horace Greeley ( ) and, by , the committed volunteers of Brook Farm led by preacher and organizer George Ripley ( ). For a brief time, as the Panic of and the ensuing economic depression spread disaffection from the business world’s norm of market individualism, hundreds of artisans, tradesmen, middle-class professionals, and enterprising pioneers flocked to communitarian settlements that offered hopes of prosperity, security, equality, and “society”—that is, cooperation and fellowship that promised an alternative to the cut-throat world of each-for-his-own. During the 1840s, cooperators formed some dozens of “phalanxes,” Fourier’s term for the collective organisms that would, in some federal fashion, create over time a worldwide network of self-sufficient groups.8 Fourier and his followers spoke less of capitalism than they did of “Civilization,” deemed in Rousseauan fashion a corrupt world of egoism, greed, luxury and penury, waste, inequality, and unfreedom—to be succeeded, ultimately, in the “New Order” of “Harmony.” If they didn’t know capitalism, Associationists certainly knew capitalists and the ravages of market competition, caustically analyzed and condemned in the penetrating but short-lived publication of the national Associationist movement, The Harbinger, which became in effect the first organ of left-wing anti-capitalist critique to appear in American society. Most of the phalanxes collapsed within a few years, if not sooner, due to factional divisions over matters of religion or policy, woefully inadequate starting resources, adverse market trends that undercut the value of the goods they hoped to sell to nearby towns and cities, and the resumption of economic growth at large that made other opportunities more attractive to restless settlers. As Guarneri points out, early enthusiasts expected the benefits of Association in greater prosperity and security to come quickly and too easily, leading to early disillusionment. More importantly, the model of the phalanx—based on investments by shareholders, differential distribution of proceeds to shareholders and non-shareholding (laboring) residents, and the sale of cooperatively produced goods in nearby markets—made the communities less a fully socialist alternative than a variant of business practice. Indeed, a political Whig like Greeley could imagine these ventures as a kind of profit-sharing corporation that could have a future in the scheme of American economic growth. Nonetheless, the pages of the Harbinger, skewering the oppression of “wage slav', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.7942068576812744, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:1534'})]
Answer: The context provided does not specifically address Japanese anti-utopian literature or its methods of crowd control, nor does it compare these to Western literature. However, it does discuss the broader themes of utopian and dystopian literature, including the influence of socialist and anti-capitalist ideas in American and European contexts. To answer your question, one would need to explore specific works of Japanese anti-utopian literature and analyze their methods of crowd control, then compare these to Western models. This would involve examining how different cultural, historical, and social contexts influence the portrayal of crowd control in dystopian narratives.

Common Criticisms

As we covered earlier, there are some definite downsides to positive punishment; it can confuse children about what they should be doing instead of the bad behavior, cause them to develop fears or other maladaptive habits or feelings, cause anger or rebelliousness, and may only lead to suppression of the behavior instead of true “extinction” of the behavior.

These are some common criticisms of the effectiveness of positive punishment, but there are also some quite strong aversions to positive punishment for another reason: whether it is ethical or not.

Many modern parents are averse to any type of positive punishment that involves unpleasant physical consequences, and for good reason—a large body of research shows that physical punishment may not only be ineffective in many cases, it may also result in unintended consequences or
Answer: The context provided does not directly address the use of punishment procedures when working with vulnerable populations. However, it does emphasize the importance of careful consideration and justification when involving vulnerable populations in research. This includes assessing the nature and degree of risk, the condition of the population, and the anticipated benefits.

Answer: When working with vulnerable populations, it is crucial to approach punishment procedures with extreme caution and ethical consideration. The context provided highlights the importance of justifying risks and ensuring the appropriateness of involving vulnerable populations in research. Similarly, when considering punishment procedures, one must carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits, taking into account the specific conditions and needs of the population involved. Positive punishment, in particular, has been criticized for potentially causing confusion, fear, anger, or rebelliousness, and may not effectively lead to behavior change. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize the well-being and dignity of vulnerable individuals, seeking alternative methods that are more supportive and less likely to result in negative consequences.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Agnosia is a rare condition characterized by difficulties recognizing or perceiving familiar objects, people, or sounds due to sensory processing deficits. It primarily affects one’s ability to understand what they see, hear, or touch.

Generally, only one of the senses (vision, hearing, or touch) is affected. Therefore, individuals with agnosia are often able to utilize their other senses to compensate and improve their quality of life. However, there are also ways to improve one’s ability to process stimuli and regain affected functions.

To help you understand what agnosia is, this article will discuss its:

Causes of Agnosia

Difficulties with recognition in individuals with agnosia are unrelated to memory, attention, or other cognitive problems. Instead, agnosia is caused by damage to the areas of the brain responsible for sensory processing, such as the posterior cortex and occipitotemporal regions.

Agnosia can develop following various neurological conditions, including:

Stroke

Tumor

Infection

Dementia

Hypoxia

Toxins

Head injury

Developmental disorders

Although agnosia affects one’s ability to recognize or perceive sensory information, the senses themselves function normally. For example, individuals who cannot recognize what they see are not experiencing a problem with their eyes. Rather, they’re experiencing a problem with the way the brain processes what their eyes see.

Depending on which areas of the brain are affected, individuals may experience a wide variety of symptoms. In the following section, we’ll differentiate the various types of agnosia.

Types of Agnosia

Agnosia affects the way the brain processes what you see, hear, or touch, but it generally only affects the processing of one of these senses.

Below, we’ll discuss the differences between visual, auditory, and tactile agnosias.

Visual Agnosia

Visual agnosia refers to difficulties recognizing what you see despite being able to see clearly. For some, certain types of objects may be more difficult to recognize than others.

Visual agnosias are the most common and best-understood type of agnosias. They can be further classified as apperceptive or associative.

Apperceptive agnosia refers to impairments caused in the early stages of visual processing when the brain gathers visual stimuli into an image. Individuals with this classification of agnosia may struggle to match two identical objects; however, they are often able to verbally identify how the objects appear (the color, texture, etc).

In contrast, associative agnosia describes the inability to assign meaning to images. Individuals with this type of agnosia can often draw, match, or copy what they see; however, they struggle to match different categories or presentations of a stimulus. For example, they may not be able to match a mechanical pencil to a wood pencil, or a closed umbrella to an open one. Additionally, individuals with associative agnosia struggle to name the objects they are looking at.

Types of visual agnosias include:

Prosopagnosia describes difficulties recognizing familiar faces. However, individuals are usually still able to identify other aspects of a person such as their gender, hair, and clothing.

Auditory Agnosia

When an individual has auditory agnosia, they are unable to recognize or perceive what they hear. Although their hearing functions are normal, the brain struggles to assign meaning to or differentiate between sounds.

Types of auditory agnosias include:

Phonagnosia describes difficulties recognizing familiar voices.

Tactile Agnosia

Tactile agnosia refers to the inability to recognize or perceive touch. Individuals with tactile agnosia can feel what they touch; however, they often struggle to identify or differentiate what they are touching.

Types of tactile agnosias include:

Amorphognosia describes difficulties identifying the size and shape of an object by touch. For example, you could not tell if an object is round or square just by feeling it.

Now that you understand the various ways agnosia can present itself following a neurological injury, the following section will discuss management interventions and treatment.

Agnosia Treatment

Agnosia treatment involves identifying sensory processing deficits and implementing effective ways to optimize the individual’s functional independence despite them. Additionally, it can involve repetitively practicing targeted exercises and activities to improve the individual’s ability to process sensory information.

A major obstacle in treating agnosia is getting the individual to acknowledge they have it. Anosognosia refers to the state of unawareness that deficits exist. As a result, individuals with anosognosia are often resistant to participating in any form of treatment, as they lack the insight needed to recognize that they have a problem.

An effective way to get an individual to acknowledge that they have agnosia is to repetitively ask them to identify or differentiate people or objects using the affected sense. Then, have the individual identify or differentiate the same stimuli using one of their unaffected senses. They should gradually become aware of their sensory processing deficits and acknowledge the need for treatment.

Compensatory Strategies

Treatment for agnosia involves learning how to use compensatory strategies to help make up for sensory processing deficits. Because agnosia generally only affects one of the senses, individuals can learn how to recognize people, objects, or places using their other, unaffected senses.

Examples of compensatory strategies include:

feeling an object if you have difficulties recognizing what it is by sight

identifying a person by their voice if you have difficulties recognizing their face

learning to use lip-reading if you have difficulties auditorily comprehending what someone is saying

By utilizing alternative cues and combining sensory modalities, individuals can improve their ability to recognize or perceive familiar objects, people, and sounds.

Rehabilitation

For individuals with less severe agnosia, treatment also focuses on rehabilitation. Individuals with agnosia are often capable of improving their deficits through intensive, task-specific practice. This is possible because the brain has neuroplasticity, which is the ability to make adaptive changes in its neural circuitry. It allows for functions affected by damage to be rewired to unaffected regions of the brain and improved through repetitive practice.

Rehabilitation approaches must be individualized and focus on the client’s specific sensory deficits. Participating in speech and occupational therapy can help individuals with agnosia identify their specific sensory deficits and practice targeted exercises and activities to stimulate the brain and improve them.

Understand Agnosia: Key Points

Agnosia is a neurological disorder characterized by difficulties recognizing or perceiving visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli. It’s caused by damage to the areas of the brain responsible for processing sensory information.

Generally, only one of the senses is affected, and individuals can learn to rely on their other senses to make up for deficits and improve their quality of life. Additionally, individuals can practice targeted exercises and activities to promote neuroadaptive changes in the brain and improve sensory processing skills.

We hope this article helped you understand what agnosia is, the various ways it can present itself, and how to optimize your quality of life if you have it.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Introducing Convolutional Neural Networks

A breakthrough in building models for image classification came with the discovery that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be used to progressively extract higher- and higher-level representations of the image content. Instead of preprocessing the data to derive features like textures and shapes, a CNN takes just the image's raw pixel data as input and "learns" how to extract these features, and ultimately infer what object they constitute.

To start, the CNN receives an input feature map: a three-dimensional matrix where the size of the first two dimensions corresponds to the length and width of the images in pixels. The size of the third dimension is 3 (corresponding to the 3 channels of a color image: red, green, and blue). The CNN comprises a stack of modules, each of which performs three operations.

1. Convolution

A convolution extracts tiles of the input feature map, and applies filters to them to compute new features, producing an output feature map, or convolved feature (which may have a different size and depth than the input feature map). Convolutions are defined by two parameters:

Size of the tiles that are extracted (typically 3x3 or 5x5 pixels).

(typically 3x3 or 5x5 pixels). The depth of the output feature map, which corresponds to the number of filters that are applied.

During a convolution, the filters (matrices the same size as the tile size) effectively slide over the input feature map's grid horizontally and vertically, one pixel at a time, extracting each corresponding tile (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. A 3x3 convolution of depth 1 performed over a 5x5 input feature map, also of depth 1. There are nine possible 3x3 locations to extract tiles from the 5x5 feature map, so this convolution produces a 3x3 output feature map.

In Figure 3, the output feature map (3x3) is smaller than the input feature map (5x5). If you instead want the output feature map to have the same dimensions as the input feature map, you can add padding (blank rows/columns with all-zero values) to each side of the input feature map, producing a 7x7 matrix with 5x5 possible locations to extract a 3x3 tile.

For each filter-tile pair, the CNN performs element-wise multiplication of the filter matrix and the tile matrix, and then sums all the elements of the resulting matrix to get a single value. Each of these resulting values for every filter-tile pair is then output in the convolved feature matrix (see Figures 4a and 4b).

Figure 4a. Left: A 5x5 input feature map (depth 1). Right: a 3x3 convolution (depth 1).

Figure 4b. Left: The 3x3 convolution is performed on the 5x5 input feature map. Right: the resulting convolved feature. Click on a value in the output feature map to see how it was calculated.

During training, the CNN "learns" the optimal values for the filter matrices that enable it to extract meaningful features (textures, edges, shapes) from the input feature map. As the number of filters (output feature map depth) applied to the input increases, so does the number of features the CNN can extract. However, the tradeoff is that filters compose the majority of resources expended by the CNN, so training time also increases as more filters are added. Additionally, each filter added to the network provides less incremental value than the previous one, so engineers aim to construct networks that use the minimum number of filters needed to extract the features necessary for accurate image classification.

2. ReLU

Following each convolution operation, the CNN applies a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transformation to the convolved feature, in order to introduce nonlinearity into the model. The ReLU function, \(F(x)=max(0,x)\), returns x for all values of x > 0, and returns 0 for all values of x ≤ 0.

ReLU is used as an activation function in a variety of neural networks; for more background, see Introduction to Neural Networks in Machine Learning Crash Course.

3. Pooling

After ReLU comes a pooling step, in which the CNN downsamples the convolved feature (to save on processing time), reducing the number of dimensions of the feature map, while still preserving the most critical feature information. A common algorithm used for this process is called max pooling.

Max pooling operates in a similar fashion to convolution. We slide over the feature map and extract tiles of a specified size. For each tile, the maximum value is output to a new feature map, and all other values are discarded. Max pooling operations take two parameters:

Size of the max-pooling filter (typically 2x2 pixels)

of the max-pooling filter (typically 2x2 pixels) Stride: the distance, in pixels, separating each extracted tile. Unlike with convolution, where filters slide over the feature map pixel by pixel, in max pooling, the stride determines the locations where each tile is extracted. For a 2x2 filter, a stride of 2 specifies that the max pooling operation will extract all nonoverlapping 2x2 tiles from the feature map (see Figure 5).

Figure 5. Left: Max pooling performed over a 4x4 feature map with a 2x2 filter and stride of 2. Right: the output of the max pooling operation. Note the resulting feature map is now 2x2, preserving only the maximum values from each tile.

Fully Connected Layers

At the end of a convolutional neural network are one or more fully connected layers (when two layers are "fully connected," every node in the first layer is connected to every node in the second layer). Their job is to perform classification based on the features extracted by the convolutions. Typically, the final fully connected layer contains a softmax activation function, which outputs a probability value from 0 to 1 for each of the classification labels the model is trying to predict.

For more on softmax and multi-class classification, see Multi-Class Neural Networks in Machine Learning Crash Course.

Figure 6 illustrates the end-to-end structure of a convolutional neural network.

Figure 6. The CNN shown here contains two convolution modules (convolution + ReLU + pooling) for feature extraction, and two fully connected layers for classification. Other CNNs may contain larger or smaller numbers of convolutional modules, and greater or fewer fully connected layers. Engineers often experiment to figure out the configuration that produces the best results for their model.
5. Classifiers on top of deep convolutional neural networks

As mentioned before, models for image classification that result from a transfer learning approach based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks are usually composed of two parts:

Convolutional base, which performs feature extraction. Classifier, which classifies the input image based on the features extracted by the convolutional base.

Since in this section we focus on the classifier part, we must start by saying that different approaches can be followed to build the classifier. Some of the most popular are:

Fully-connected layers. For image classification problems, the standard approach is to use a stack of fully-connected layers followed by a softmax activated layer (Krizhevsky et al. 2012, Simonyan & Zisserman 2014, Zeiler & Fergus 2014). The softmax layer outputs the probability distribution over each possible class label and then we just need to classify the image according to the most probable class. Global average pooling. A different approach, based on global average pooling, is proposed by Lin et al. (2013). In this approach, instead of adding fully connected layers on top of the convolutional base, we add a global average pooling layer and feed its output directly into the softmax activated layer. Lin et al. (2013) provides a detailed discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. Linear support vector machines. Linear support vector machines (SVM) is another possible approach. According to Tang (2013), we can improve classification accuracy by training a linear SVM classifier on the features extracted by the convolutional base. Further details about the advantages and disadvantages of the SVM approach can be found in the paper.

6. Example

In this example, we will see how each of these classifiers can be implemented in a transfer learning solution for image classification. According to Rawat and Wang (2017), ‘comparing the performance of different classifiers on top of deep convolutional neural networks still requires further investigation and thus makes for an interesting research direction’. So it will be interesting to see how each classifier performs in a standard image classification problem.

You can find the full code of this example on my GitHub page.

6.1. Prepare data

In this example, we will use a smaller version of the original dataset. This will allow us to run the models faster, which is great for people who have limited computational power (like me).

To build a smaller version of the dataset, we can adapt the code provided by Chollet (2017) as shown in Code 1.

Code 1. Create a smaller dataset for Dogs vs. Cats.

6.2. Extract features from the convolutional base

The convolutional base will be used to extract features. These features will feed the classifiers that we want to train so that we can identify if images have dogs or cats.

Once again, the code provided by Chollet (2017) is adapted. Code 2 shows the code used.

Code 2. Extract features from convolutional base.

6.3. Classifiers

6.3.1. Fully-connected layers

The first solution that we present is based on fully-connected layers. This classifier adds a stack of fully-connected layers that is fed by the features extracted from the convolutional base.

To keep it simple (and fast), we will use the solution proposed by Chollet (2018) with slight modifications. In particular, we will use the Adam optimizer instead of the RMSProp because Stanford says so (what a beautiful argumentum ad verecundiam).

Code 3 shows the code used, while Figures 5 and 6 present the learning curves.

Code 3. Fully connected layers solution.

Figure 5. Accuracy of the fully connected layers solution.

Figure 6. Loss of the fully connected layers solution.

Brief discussion of results:

Validation accuracy is around 0.85, which is encouraging given the size of the dataset. The model strongly overfits. There’s a big gap between the training and the validation curves. Since we already used dropout, we should increase the size of the dataset to improve the results.

6.3.2. Global average pooling

The difference between this case and the previous one is that, instead of adding a stack of fully-connected layers, we will add a global average pooling layer and feed its output into a sigmoid activated layer.

Note that we are talking about a sigmoid activated layer instead of a softmax one, which is what is recommended by Lin et al. (2013). We are changing to the sigmoid activation because in Keras, to perform binary classification, you should use sigmoid activation and binary_crossentropy as the loss (Chollet 2017). Therefore, it was necessary to do this small modification to the original proposal of Lin et al. (2013).

Code 4 shows the code to build the classifier. Figure 7 and 8 show the resulting learning curves.

Code 4. Global average pooling solution.

Figure 7. Accuracy of the global average pooling solution.

Figure 8. Loss of the global average pooling solution.

Brief discussion of results:

Validation accuracy is similar to the one resulting from the fully-connected layers solution. The model doesn’t overfit as much as in the previous case. The loss function is still decreasing when the model stops training. Probably, it is possible to improve the model by increasing the number of epochs.

6.3.3 Linear support vector machines

In this case, we will train a linear support vector machines (SVM) classifier on the features extracted by the convolutional base.

To train this classifier, a traditional machine learning approach is preferable. Consequently, we will use k-fold cross-validation to estimate the error of the classifier. Since k-fold cross-validation will be used, we can concatenate the train and the validation sets to enlarge our training data (we keep the test set untouched, as we did in the previous cases). Code 5 shows how data was concatenated.

Code 5. Data concatenation.

Finally, we must be aware that the SVM classifier has one hyperparameter. This hyperparameter is the penalty parameter C of the error term. To optimize the choice of this hyperparameter, we will use exhaustive grid search. Code 6 presents the code used to build this classifier, while Figure 9 illustrates the learning curves.

Code 6. Linear SVM solution.

Figure 9. Accuracy of the linear SVM solution.

Brief discussion of results:

Model’s accuracy is around 0.86, which is similar to the accuracy of the previous solutions. Overfitting is around the corner. Moreover, the training accuracy is always 1.0, which is not usual and can be interpreted as a sign of overfitting. The accuracy of the model should increase with the number of training samples. However, that doesn’t seem to happen. This may be due to overfitting. It would be interesting to see how the model reacts when the dataset increases.

7. Summary

In this article, we:

Presented the concepts of transfer learning, convolutional neural networks, and pre-trained models.

Defined the basic fine-tuning strategies to repurpose a pre-trained model.

Described a structured approach to decide which fine-tuning strategy should be used, based on the size and similarity of the dataset.

Introduced three different classifiers that can be used on top of the features extracted from the convolutional base.

Provided a end-to-end example on image classification for each of the three classifiers presented in this article.

I hope that you feel motivated to start developing your deep learning projects on computer vision. This is a great field of study and new exciting findings are coming out everyday.

I’d be glad to help you, so let me know if you have any questions or improvement suggestions!

Answer: To create a system capable of detecting dogs in a public park using 100 thousand images of dogs, you can follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Organize your dataset of 100 thousand images, ensuring it is labeled correctly (e.g., images with dogs and without dogs if you have such data).
   - Consider augmenting your dataset to increase its size and variability, which can help improve the model's robustness. Techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping can be used for augmentation.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor. This involves using the convolutional base of a CNN to extract features from your images. This approach leverages transfer learning, which is beneficial when you have a large dataset like 100 thousand images.

3. **Classifier Selection**:
   - Choose a classifier to place on top of the extracted features. You have several options:
     - **Fully-Connected Layers**: Add a stack of fully-connected layers followed by a softmax activated layer for classification. This is a standard approach for image classification.
     - **Global Average Pooling**: Use a global average pooling layer followed by a sigmoid activated layer for binary classification (detecting the presence of dogs).
     - **Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Train a linear SVM on the features extracted by the convolutional base. This approach can sometimes improve classification accuracy.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train your chosen classifier using the features extracted from the convolutional base. Use techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting, especially since you have a large dataset.
   - Consider using k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance and ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to ensure it can accurately detect dogs in various conditions.
   - Monitor metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Once the model is trained and evaluated, deploy it in a system capable of processing images from a public park in real-time or near-real-time.
   - Ensure the system is optimized for speed and accuracy, possibly using techniques like model quantization or pruning if necessary.

By following these steps, you can create a robust system for detecting dogs in a public park using your dataset of 100 thousand images.

Context: [RetrieverResultItem(content='{\'id\': \':0\', \'index\': 0, \'text\': \'Introducing Convolutional Neural Networks\\n\\nA breakthrough in building models for image classification came with the discovery that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be used to progressively extract higher- and higher-level representations of the image content. Instead of preprocessing the data to derive features like textures and shapes, a CNN takes just the image\\\'s raw pixel data as input and "learns" how to extract these features, and ultimately infer what object they constitute.\\n\\nTo start, the CNN receives an input feature map: a three-dimensional matrix where the size of the first two dimensions corresponds to the length and width of the images in pixels. The size of the third dimension is 3 (corresponding to the 3 channels of a color image: red, green, and blue). The CNN comprises a stack of modules, each of which performs three operations.\\n\\n1. Convolution\\n\\nA convolution extracts tiles of the input feature map, and applies filters to them to compute new features, producing an output feature map, or convolved feature (which may have a different size and depth than the input feature map). Convolutions are defined by two parameters:\\n\\nSize of the tiles that are extracted (typically 3x3 or 5x5 pixels).\\n\\n(typically 3x3 or 5x5 pixels). The depth of the output feature map, which corresponds to the number of filters that are applied.\\n\\nDuring a convolution, the filters (matrices the same size as the tile size) effectively slide over the input feature map\\\'s grid horizontally and vertically, one pixel at a time, extracting each corresponding tile (see Figure 3).\\n\\nFigure 3. A 3x3 convolution of depth 1 performed over a 5x5 input feature map, also of depth 1. There are nine possible 3x3 locations to extract tiles from the 5x5 feature map, so this convolution produces a 3x3 output feature map.\\n\\nIn Figure 3, the output feature map (3x3) is smaller than the input feature map (5x5). If you instead want the output feature map to have the same dimensions as the input feature map, you can add padding (blank rows/columns with all-zero values) to each side of the input feature map, producing a 7x7 matrix with 5x5 possible locations to extract a 3x3 tile.\\n\\nFor each filter-tile pair, the CNN performs element-wise multiplication of the filter matrix and the tile matrix, and then sums all the elements of the resulting matrix to get a single value. Each of these resulting values for every filter-tile pair is then output in the convolved feature matrix (see Figures 4a and 4b).\\n\\nFigure 4a. Left: A 5x5 input feature map (depth 1). Right: a 3x3 convolution (depth 1).\\n\\nFigure 4b. Left: The 3x3 convolution is performed on the 5x5 input feature map. Right: the resulting convolved feature. Click on a value in the output feature map to see how it was calculated.\\n\\nDuring training, the CNN "learns" the optimal values for the filter matrices that enable it to extract meaningful features (textures, edges, shapes) from the input feature map. As the number of filters (output feature map depth) applied to the input increases, so does the number of features the CNN can extract. However, the tradeoff is that filters compose the majority of resources expended by the CNN, so training time also increases as more filters are added. Additionally, each filter added to the network provides less incremental value than the previous one, so engineers aim to construct networks that use the minimum number of filters needed to extract the features necessary for accurate image classification.\\n\\n2. ReLU\\n\\nFollowing each convolution operation, the CNN applies a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transformation to the convolved feature, in order to introduce nonlinearity into the model. The ReLU function, \\\\(F(x)=max(0,x)\\\\), returns x for all values of x > 0, and returns 0 for all values of x ≤ 0.\\n\\nReLU is used as an activation function in a variety of neural networks; for more background, see Introduction to Neural Networks in Machine Learning Crash Course.\\n\\n3. Pooling\\n\\nAfter ReLU comes a pooling step, in which the CNN downsamples the convolved feature (to save on processing time), reducing the number of dimensions of the feature map, while still preserving the most critical feature information. A common algorithm used for this process is called max pooling.\\n\\nMax pooling operates in a similar fashion to convolution. We slide over the feature map and extract tiles of a specified size. For each tile, the maximum value is output to a new feature map, and all other values are discarded. Max pooling operations take two parameters:\\n\\nSize of the max-pooling filter (typically 2x2 pixels)\\n\\nof the max-pooling filter (typically 2x2 pixels) Stride: the distance, in pixels, separating each extracted tile. Unlike with convolution, where filters slide over the feature map pixel by pixel, in max pooling, the stride determines the locations where each tile is extracted. For a 2x2 filter, a stride of 2 specifies that the max pooling operation will extract all nonoverlapping 2x2 tiles from the feature map (see Figure 5).\\n\\nFigure 5. Left: Max pooling performed over a 4x4 feature map with a 2x2 filter and stride of 2. Right: the output of the max pooling operation. Note the resulting feature map is now 2x2, preserving only the maximum values from each tile.\\n\\nFully Connected Layers\\n\\nAt the end of a convolutional neural network are one or more fully connected layers (when two layers are "fully connected," every node in the first layer is connected to every node in the second layer). Their job is to perform classification based on the features extracted by the convolutions. Typically, the final fully connected layer contains a softmax activation function, which outputs a probability value from 0 to 1 for each of the classification labels the model is trying to predict.\\n\\nFor more on softmax and multi-class classification, see Multi-Class Neural Networks in Machine Learning Crash Course.\\n\\nFigure 6 illustrates the end-to-end structure of a convolutional neural network.\\n\\nFigure 6. The CNN shown here contains two convolution modules (convolution + ReLU + pooling) for feature extraction, and two fully connected layers for classification. Other CNNs may contain larger or smaller numbers of convolutional modules, and greater or fewer fully connected layers. Engineers often experiment to figure out the configuration that produces the best results for their model.\', \'embedding\': None}', metadata={'score': 0.8264360427856445, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:1828'}), RetrieverResultItem(content="{'id': ':1', 'index': 1, 'text': 'ions from the entire training set shown on the right. In this case, the example was correctly classified as a real target. However, in many cases, the classification is on the tails of either distribution, making the decision more difficult. In such cases, the activation distributions can be used either to define the crossover decision point or quantify the classification in terms of a confidence level.\\n\\nThe activation distributions are also very useful in optimising the false alarm and detection rates. An N-stage network was developed recursively from the uncertain examples resulting from a series of training sessions using progressively larger confidence levels. This generates a receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-type analysis where detector sensitivity is analogous to confidence level. The ROC curve shown in Figure 6 was derived from a three-stage neural network where confidence levels from 0.5 to 0.95 resulted in the probabilities of detection and false alarm shown on the X and Y axes, respectively.\\n\\nSummary and Future Directions\\n\\nAlthough the prototype offers a convincing proof of concept (93% probability of detection and 6% probability of false alarm for a single-stage neural network), future success will depend largely on effective integration and fast implementations of existing software. The extraction of small targets requires the processing of side-scan data at its full resolution, which has demonstrated the need for accelerated processing speeds well in excess of those used in the prototyping phase. Consequently, continued test-bed development for fast and flexible image processing and analysis of side-scan data appears to be critical.\\n\\nIn the coming year, SAIC also plans to implement active learning strategies that allow the system to learn as new data are acquired.

Answer: To create a system capable of detecting dogs in a public park using your dataset of 100 thousand images of dogs, you can follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Ensure your dataset is well-labeled, with images clearly marked as containing dogs. If possible, include images of various breeds, sizes, and in different environments to improve model generalization.
   - Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, as CNNs are well-suited for extracting features from images and can learn to identify dogs based on the raw pixel data.
   - Consider using a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet) and fine-tuning it on your dataset. Pre-trained models can save time and resources as they have already learned useful features from large datasets.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the CNN on your dataset, allowing it to learn the optimal filter values to extract meaningful features such as textures, edges, and shapes that are characteristic of dogs.
   - Use techniques like data augmentation to artificially increase the diversity of your training data, which can help improve the model's robustness.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set and adjust hyperparameters as needed to improve accuracy.
   - Use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's ability to detect dogs accurately.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a real-time system capable of processing video feeds or images from cameras in the park.
   - Implement a pipeline that includes preprocessing the input data, running it through the CNN, and post-processing the results to identify and highlight detected dogs.

6. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Implement active learning strategies to continuously improve the model by retraining it with new data collected from the park.
   - Monitor the system's performance and make necessary adjustments to maintain high detection accuracy.

By following these steps, you can develop a robust system for detecting dogs in a public park using your dataset of dog images.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: What is a third-degree burn?

A third-degree burn is referred to as a full thickness burn. This type of burn destroys the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the entire layer beneath (the dermis).

What causes a third-degree burn?

In most cases, full thickness, third-degree burns are caused by the following: A scalding liquid

Skin that comes in contact with a hot object for an extended period of time

Flames from a fire

An electrical source

A chemical source

What are the symptoms of a third-degree burn?

The following are the most common symptoms of a full thickness, third-degree burn. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include: Dry and leathery skin

Black, white, brown, or yellow skin

Swelling

Lack of pain because nerve endings have been destroyed Large, full thickness, third-degree burns heal slowly and poorly without medical attention. Because the epidermis and hair follicles are destroyed, new skin will not grow. The symptoms of a third-degree burn may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Consult your child's physician for a diagnosis. Third degree burns should always be evaluated immediately in the emergency department. They may require transfer to a burn center for further treatment.

Treatment for third-degree burns

Specific treatment for a full thickness third-degree burn will be determined by your child's doctor, based on the following: Your child's age, overall health, and medical history

Extent of the burn

Location of the burn

Cause of the burn

Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies

Your opinion or preference Treatment for full thickness, third-degree burns will depend on the severity of the burn. Burn severity is determined by the amount of body surface area that has been affected. The burn severity will be determined by your child's doctor. Treatment for third-degree burns may include the following: Early cleaning and debriding (removing dead skin and tissue from the burned area). This procedure can be done in a special bathtub in the hospital or as a surgical procedure.

Intravenous (IV) fluids containing electrolytes

Intravenous (IV) or oral antibiotics if your child develops an infection

Antibiotic ointments or creams

A warm, humid environment for the burn

Nutritional supplements and a high-protein diet

Pain medications

Skin grafting (may be required to achieve closure of the wounded area)

Functional and cosmetic reconstruction

Tetanus shot

What is a skin graft?

A skin graft is a piece of the child's unburned skin which is surgically removed to cover a burned area. Skin grafts can be thin or thick. Skin grafts are performed in the operating room. The burn that is covered with a skin graft is called a graft site.

What is a donor site?

The area where the piece of unburned skin was taken to be donated to a burned area is called a donor site. After a skin graft procedure, the donor sites look like a scraped or skinned knee. Your child's doctor will decide if a skin graft is needed. A skin graft is often performed after debridement or removal of the dead skin and tissue.

Graft site care

A dressing is left on the graft site for two to five days before it is changed, so that the new skin will stay in place. For the first several days, graft sites need to be kept very still and protected from rubbing or pressure.

Donor site care
Overview

Third-degree burns are a severe burn that reaches the third layer of your skin.

What is a third-degree burn?

Third-degree burns are a serious type of burn that requires immediate medical attention. A burn is damage to your skin or underlying tissue due to extreme temperatures, a chemical or a light source.

A third-degree burn damages the top layer of your skin (epidermis), the middle layer of your skin (dermis) and the layer of fat underneath your skin (hypodermis). A third-degree burn can also damage your sweat glands, hair follicles and nerve endings.

You won’t feel immediate pain if you have a third-degree burn because the burn destroyed your nerves. This can make you believe that your burn isn’t serious, but it is, and you should see a healthcare provider for treatment.

What does a third-degree burn look like?

Features of a third-degree burn include:

Leathery skin.

Dry skin.

Skin discoloration that’s white, black or bright red.

Swelling.

A third-degree burn won’t blanch or turn white temporarily when you press on your affected skin. Blanching is common for first- and second-degree burns.

A third-degree burn will likely have features of a second-degree burn around it, including:

Blisters.

Shiny, moist skin.

Skin discoloration from a deep red to dark brown.

Where are common locations for third-degree burns?

You can get a third-degree burn anywhere on your body depending on what caused the burn. Common locations for a third-degree burn include your:

Hands.

Face.

Feet.

Arms and legs.

How does a third-degree burn compare to other types of burns?

The number of each degree of burn identifies how many layers of damage your body has, including:

First-degree burn : Damage to the top layer of skin.

: Damage to the top layer of skin. Second-degree burn : Damage to the top and middle layers of skin.

: Damage to the top and middle layers of skin. Third-degree burn: Damage to the top and middle layers of skin and the fatty layer (hypodermis).

While less common, extremely serious burns can extend past three degrees and could include:

Fourth-degree burn : Damage past your hypodermis into subcutaneous fat, nerves and tendons.

: Damage past your hypodermis into subcutaneous fat, nerves and tendons. Fifth-degree burn : Damage to your muscle.

: Damage to your muscle. Sixth-degree burn: Damage to your bone.

If you have a first- or second-degree burn that’s less than 3 inches in diameter or a burn that’s not on your face, you can treat your burn at home. Serious burns or large burns include third-degree burns and up. See a healthcare provider if you have a serious burn.
Answer: Treating a patient with 80% of their body affected by third-degree burns is a complex and critical medical situation that requires immediate and specialized care. Here are the general steps that would be taken in such a scenario:

1. **Immediate Medical Attention**: The patient should be taken to an emergency department immediately. Due to the severity of the burns, they will likely need to be transferred to a specialized burn center for further treatment.

2. **Stabilization**: Initial treatment will focus on stabilizing the patient. This includes ensuring adequate airway, breathing, and circulation. Intravenous (IV) fluids containing electrolytes will be administered to prevent shock and maintain blood pressure.

3. **Infection Prevention**: The risk of infection is high with extensive burns. The patient may receive intravenous (IV) or oral antibiotics to prevent or treat infections.

4. **Pain Management**: Although third-degree burns may not cause immediate pain due to nerve damage, pain management is still crucial for overall comfort and to address any surrounding second-degree burns.

5. **Wound Care**: Early cleaning and debriding (removing dead skin and tissue) of the burned areas will be performed. This can be done in a special bathtub in the hospital or as a surgical procedure.

6. **Skin Grafting**: Given the extent of the burns, skin grafting will likely be necessary. This involves taking healthy skin from an unburned area of the patient's body (donor site) and transplanting it to the burned areas (graft site).

7. **Nutritional Support**: The patient will require nutritional supplements and a high-protein diet to support healing and recovery.

8. **Environmental Control**: The patient will be kept in a warm, humid environment to aid in healing.

9. **Rehabilitation**: Functional and cosmetic reconstruction may be needed, along with physical therapy to regain mobility and function.

10. **Tetanus Shot**: A tetanus shot may be administered to prevent tetanus infection.

Due to the complexity and severity of the situation, the treatment plan will be tailored to the patient's specific needs by a team of healthcare professionals.

Answer: In the context of the South African JBCC (Joint Building Contracts Committee) Principal Building Agreement, if a Contractor fails to bring a project to completion but is requesting 100% payment before completing the remaining works, several clauses may be relevant to govern and address this situation:

1. **Payment Provisions**: The JBCC agreement typically outlines the conditions under which payments are made. Payments are usually linked to the completion of specific work stages or milestones. The Contractor is generally not entitled to full payment until the work is completed as per the contract terms.

2. **Default and Remedies**: The JBCC agreement includes provisions for default by the Contractor. If the Contractor fails to perform their obligations, the Employer may have the right to withhold payment or take other remedial actions as specified in the contract.

3. **Certification of Payment**: The agreement requires that payments be certified by the Principal Agent. The Principal Agent must ensure that the work has been completed to the required standard before certifying payment.

4. **Retention**: The contract may include a retention clause, where a percentage of the payment is withheld until the project is satisfactorily completed. This provides an incentive for the Contractor to complete the work.

5. **Dispute Resolution**: If there is a disagreement over payment or completion, the JBCC agreement provides mechanisms for dispute resolution, such as mediation, adjudication, or arbitration.

It is important to review the specific terms and conditions of the JBCC Principal Building Agreement Edition 6.2, May 2018, as these will govern the rights and obligations of the parties involved. Additionally, consulting with a legal professional or a JBCC contract expert may be advisable to navigate the specific circumstances of the case.

Context: To pick the right tools for your project, first become acquainted with what is available and what the tool does. Next, get to know your project. Irrespective of the process improvement methodology you choose, you can always dip in and out of other methodologies and use the tools and techniques that suit your situation. The following are different tools and techniques, why one would use them, and what methodology they derive from.

Process Mapping

Process mapping, also called brown paper process mapping and analysis, refers to creating detailed visual displays of all the steps from beginning to end. These visuals help to manage workflows. Examples of process maps include flowcharts, swim lane diagrams built in BPMN, state diagrams, data flow diagrams, and value stream mapping. Assembling process maps enables organizations to understand and picture the steps, inputs, outputs, resources, team members, strengths, and weaknesses in each process. For more information see “Essential Guide to Business Process Mapping.”

Statistical Process Control (SPC)

Statistical process control (SPC) is the tool of TQM that mathematically reduces the variation. SPC uses statistics to scrutinize and control a process. Using industry standards, quality data is compiled in real time during manufacturing and graphed with control limits set by the process capabilities. When data falls in the control limits, it means the operations are working as expected.

Simulation

Acting as a powerful tool for process improvement, simulation is an efficient way to scrutinize your operations under a variety of conditions. Most simulation is done with a software program targeted to the specific process. You can insert randomness and experimentation into a simulation to help your business figure out what they would do and possible breakpoints.

Kanban

One of the tools of continuous process improvement methodologies is a visual workflow tool called Kanban. You can also use this tool for projects that require rapid improvement on specific projects and teams. Write each step (in the case of one project) or project on sticky notes, notecards, or tickets, and arrange the visual cards in columns that display the stage of each task or project (examples include ready, doing, and done, and to do, in progress, and completed). Other concepts for Kanban boards include work in progress (WIP) limits, which limit the maximum number of work steps or projects in each column — this helps keep your teams narrowly focused. Others include a backlog for ideas and projects (often called the parking lot), and the delivery point that details the amount of time each task takes to move from the first stage to the last. This is where the continuous improvement comes in: the time from the first to last column should decrease. Read more on Kanban here.

Operations Analysis

Sometimes called operational research or industrial engineering, operations analysis is the study of an operational system to improve it. There are six steps to operational analysis:

Outline the problem. The best problem statements get to the root of the issue without posing solutions or explaining what the problem is not. The problem statement format should contain the object and the defect. Determine what data you have and what data you need. Strong data collection is not for the faint of heart. Be extremely specific about what questions you are trying to answer. For example, if you are trying to figure out whether your product modification works for your customers, ask them specific questions about the modification, not whether they enjoy the product. Benchmarking looks at the best practices in your industry and in other industries and then determines how your data lines up. Determine the patterns. Some data collected is more important that other data. If you follow the Pareto principle, which states that 80 percent of your effects or problems are caused by 20 percent of your issues — or better yet, that 80 percent of your results come from 20 percent of your actions — then you understand that fixing some pain points has a larger effect than others. Experts suggest that a visual analysis of your processing will provide a distinct perspective than will words on paper or telling the story. Be aware that random variations can occur and may not constitute a trend. Finally, look for the bottlenecks that surely exist. You can find bottlenecks just after the backlog, where you find unhappy customers. Steer clear of making rash conclusions. Before you point fingers at anyone or decide anything, make sure that the data supports it. Consider the effects before placing any blame. Come up with solutions. Initial brainstorming sessions should be facilitated by someone who can ensure the group is not trying to gain an advantage over each other by shouting out disparate ideas. Instead, focus the group on one idea and add or expand that idea into many concepts. Use the mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive principle (MECE) when divvying up your ideas: Categories should be mutually exclusive to avoid being counted more than once and drill down to create a list of all the viable solutions. Have a category labeled “other” so you don’t miss anything. Test. Once you determine with process tweaks, test them. Tweak from what you’ve learned and test again, until you have the process the way you need it.

The Five Whys

This simple concept ensures that in any issue, you look behind the face value and ask “Why?” five times until you get to the root of a problem. Each answer to a why question forms the basis for the next question, and is meant to be used when troubleshooting, problem solving, or in quality improvement projects. The five whys is most effective with simple or moderately difficult problems. This tool urges you to follow a specific track when there could be several tracks that you need to follow.

Here is one example of how a five whys process might look:

1. Why did the software fail?

The database overloaded, causing it to seize.

2. Why is the database overloaded?

There is insufficient space, so it seized.

3. Why is there insufficient space?

We have another piece of software that used the space.

4. Why do we have another piece of software using the space?

We planned to have them share.

5. Why are they sharing?

Because we do not have a dedicated database for the new software yet.

This is a simplistic example, but what you do not see in the questions is embedded solutions. You see a portion of the answer drilling down into the next question. This method is popular, particularly with Lean practitioners, when trying to find out why something unexpected has happened. The purpose of this exercise is not to place blame, but rather to uncover a root cause. You can use this technique on its own, or as a part of a fishbone diagram (shown below).

A fishbone diagram is a visualization tool helps you categorize all the potential causes of a problem so you can identify its root causes. The head of the diagram states the problem, and you can have many different branches for the causes.

In this example, you see four potential causes. Beneath each are the sub-causes. In this case, there are three for each cause, but these can range from one sub-cause to many. If you are using the five whys, choose which cause you want to start with on one of the fins and then ask the questions. In this example, “Method” was chosen for the first cause. You can see where to add the answers to your five questions. Fill in more fins to review all the plausible causes.

Swim Lanes

If you want to draw a single process map for the sake of simplicity, consider using swim lanes. As evidenced by the name, swim lanes connotate straight, narrow lanes of ownership. A part of Business Process and Modeling Notation (BPMN), swim lanes are a standardized way of looking at a process for who “owns” it, and where handoffs occur. BPMN is a straightforward, standardized language. There are hundreds of symbols that may be used, but the vast majority of professionals use only a handful. As you can see in the diagram below, the “Lanes” (or swim lanes) signify who owns that portion of the process and where the process dips to other owners.

Value Stream Maps

One aspect of Lean is value stream mapping, which is a way to to visualize the flow of materials and information as the product or service goes through its value stream. Every step of the process is accounted for in detail. The state that you start with is the as-is or current state, and you can use another model to develop your to-be or future state. In the example below, time is detailed for each step of a process.
Every company requires processes to conduct business. The better you can execute, the more effective your organization becomes. Raise your company’s effectiveness by implementing process improvement.

Processes are a part of every company’s operations. How well an organization implements and executes these processes affects the company’s effectiveness. Operational performance impacts all parts of the business, from controlling costs to delivery of a product or service to clients.

In turn, it also influences the customer experience, and can either lead to repeat business or customers posting on social media about a terrible ordeal.

To improve the former and avoid the latter, your business requires an efficient, systematic approach that minimizes errors, reduces costs, and achieves a benchmark standard of productivity and quality.

Although that’s the goal when setting up a process, the first time is not always going to be successful. On top of that, over time, a process needs to be reassessed to validate it’s still achieving the required objectives. That’s when the concept of process improvement comes into play.

Overview: What is process improvement?

When a company encounters operational challenges, complaints from customers, or simply wants to optimize existing workflows, it’s time to implement process improvements. So what does the term mean exactly?

Process improvement is about identifying an area of the organization where existing business processes are lacking in some capacity. This could be defined in terms of product or service quality, meeting key business metrics like a quota, or customer satisfaction.

Once the problem area is identified, then it’s about implementing changes that optimize the existing processes to meet or exceed the required standards.

What are some common process improvement methodologies?

Process improvement is so important to business success that a number of methodologies have developed over time to address this key concept. Here are some of the most common process improvement models.

1. Six Sigma

One of the most famous process improvement frameworks is Six Sigma. It’s a set of techniques designed to improve quality by eliminating defects or errors from a given workflow. Six Sigma strategies are applied continuously to a process until variations are eradicated and the process produces consistent and predictable results.

This methodology is known for its use of karate belt colors to denote a practitioner’s level of understanding of the framework with white belts representing novices and black belts indicating Six Sigma experts.

2. Kaizen

A process improvement methodology born in Japan, kaizen espouses the idea that business improvement is continuous and never ending. It aims to eliminate all waste from process flows to achieve a high level of efficiency and productivity.

Kaizen is known for its team approach where everyone in the organization shares ideas and works together to keep improving every area of a business. If mistakes occur, the goal is to learn from them as part of the cycle of continuous improvement.

3. PDCA

Plan-do-check-act (PDCA) outlines a four-step scientific approach spelled out in its name. You begin by identifying the areas requiring improvement. Next, you implement changes then collect data to analyze if the changes had the desired impact.

Finally, you take action based on your data analysis.

4. BPR

Business process re-engineering (BPR) is a framework that tackles process improvement at scale. Rather than address a small component of an overall workflow, BPR attempts to address issues and eliminate unnecessary steps by holistically redesigning an entire process from end to end.

The changes can be so substantial that a change management plan typically accompanies the use of BPR.

5. Gap analysis

One flexible framework to employ when a process is failing, or to elevate your business to the next level, is a gap analysis. This approach involves an examination of where your business is at today, where you want it to be, and how you can close this gap.

It’s not limited to operational improvements either. You can implement this methodology to confront gaps in product features against the competition, to improve profitability, and even to address manpower shortages.

6. Process mapping

A useful approach that applies careful analysis and a visualization tool to address process issues -- or to create a new workflow from scratch -- is process mapping. In this method, you create a document that details the steps in a procedure, usually captured in a flowchart.

The document allows you to see the entire process and identify areas to change. It then serves as a reference tool for subsequent process changes, or for writing a runbook.

Process improvement best practices for your business

As part of improving processes in your organization, look to incorporate the following best practices into your plan.

1. Set quantifiable goals

Even before process improvement steps can be taken, you first must define a quantifiable goal or set of deliverables you’re aiming for. So once you’ve identified an area of the business requiring change, determine a set of metrics that can be used to measure if changes are working, and to know when you’ve reached your objective.

For instance, if the accounting department is slow to handle invoices, it can delay a company’s ability to obtain payment. In this case, setting a goal of completing the invoicing process within 48 hours is an example of a measurable objective to achieve as part of a process improvement plan.

2. Prioritize the customer

Incorporate and prioritize the needs of your customers as part of any process improvement project. From deciding which procedure to improve first to the solution itself, consider the impact to your customers.

Any process creating pain for your customers must be addressed first. When outlining a solution, think about how the changes will improve the customer experience. To identify these factors, perform customer interviews, and dig into your company’s customer data such as analyzing how often clients perform subsequent purchases and customer churn rate.

When examining customer data, it’s ideal to extract this information from your CRM software. A CRM captures every detail of a customer’s interactions with your company, making it easy to analyze the process improvements that will make the biggest impact to your clients.

3. Incorporate technology

Many manual procedures can be streamlined by introducing technology. In addition, technology can reduce costs while improving quality.

Today, businesses enjoy a wide array of technical solutions capable of addressing virtually any process improvement need. From project management software to streamline oversight of a project to employing a CRM for business development, many tools exist that can transform cumbersome steps by introducing automated workflows, eliminating human errors, and reducing the amount of time required to complete work.

Keep in mind that replacing a manual process with technology is not necessarily an improvement. Perhaps those manual pieces can be eliminated completely as part of a process improvement project. So although injecting technology into your operations will provide benefits, it should deliver substantial gains to make the investment in time and money worthwhile.

Process improvement steps

Given how process improvements deliver a range of organizational benefits from better communication to increased profitability, it’s essential to know how to implement a process improvement plan. Here are the steps to do so.

Step 1: Identify the improvement opportunity

Before you can dive into process improvement planning, as mentioned in the best practices, you must establish a quantifiable goal first, such as when Amazon wanted one-day shipping of its products to customers. Once this objective is defined, it’s time to examine the existing workflows related to that goal achievement.

The purpose of this step is to understand the current processes and at what points do they fail to add value to achieving the overarching objectives. When Amazon wanted to accelerate product delivery times, it had to examine existing operations to identify where improvement opportunities existed, such as strategic placement of warehouses to take advantage of where its airplanes were located.

Tips for identifying improvement opportunities:

It’s not always easy to spot the places where improvement can occur, especially if you’re deeply familiar with an existing process so that the steps seem like second nature to you. Apply the following suggestions to help.

Find the pain points: To discover where improvement is needed, look for signs where the current process is failing. Identify the location of bottlenecks and where multiple steps are required to complete just a portion of a procedure. A clear sign of a process pain point is at the stage where customers or employees are becoming frustrated with the workflow. Find the areas where work needs to be regularly redone, or it’s being repeated by different people. This duplication of effort is a waste of time and resources, so you’ll want to find a way to eliminate it.

Find the areas where work needs to be regularly redone, or it’s being repeated by different people. This duplication of effort is a waste of time and resources, so you’ll want to find a way to eliminate it. Map the processes: Catching the points where a process is failing becomes much easier if you can see a visual representation of it. Here, a process map detailing the entire workflow from start to finish helps flag the issues. It also serves as a reference document to use with others in the organization as solutions are worked through.

Step 2: Obtain stakeholder buy-in

People are at the heart of nearly every process. Those involved in executing a procedure should be brought in to help improve it. This communicates what’s happening and getting their buy-in at the same time.

In addition, any other stakeholders in the organization should be informed of the process improvement efforts, and their support should be obtained as well. This avoids any potential conflict down the road.

Don’t forget to loop in customers, too. If it’s an externally-facing process change, customers must be informed in advance of the change to avoid confusion and a poor user experience when the change arrives.

Tips for obtaining stakeholder buy-in:

Getting people within your organization to support process improvements can be a challenge. Here are tips to overcome this hurdle.

Explain the rationale: People are naturally resistant to change, even if it’s for the better. That’s why you must explain the reasons behind the process improvements to obtain buy-in. Moreover, by detailing how the changes will deliver value, such as a better customer experience, stakeholders become motivated to help you.

People are naturally resistant to change, even if it’s for the better. That’s why you must explain the reasons behind the process improvements to obtain buy-in. Moreover, by detailing how the changes will deliver value, such as a better customer experience, stakeholders become motivated to help you. Clarify roles: Stakeholders hold varying degrees of involvement in process changes. As a result, ensure every stakeholder is clear on their role in the business process improvement plan. For example, some people may be directly involved in executing process changes while others are indirectly affected by it, and hence, do not take an active role in the implementation. So for those directly involved, they must carve out time to help transition to new processes.

Step 3: Design the process improvement plan

Outlining the process improvements takes place at this stage. Bring together the information gathered in the first step with the stakeholders identified in the second step as taking an active role in the process to form a plan.

Determining the changes required to improve a process isn’t the only component in the plan. You and your team must also decide how you will measure the effectiveness of the changes, evaluate any risks, and identify how the changes will affect the customer experience.

Once all of these elements have been vetted and a course of action determined, any previous process mapping can be revised to lay out the new process, and used as a tool to create training materials.

Tips for designing the process improvement plan:

Keep these tips in mind when outlining the changes required to improve a process.

Standardize the process: Ensure your plan objective is to develop a standardized process. A new procedure must create uniformity. Doing so improves both productivity and quality as well as making sure predictable outcomes are achieved. Here, introducing a technical solution to streamline the workflow helps, particularly if the solution automates many of the process steps.

Create a project plan: Transforming processes impacts an organization to varying degrees depending on the extent of the changes. If the process improvement is larger than small adjustments affecting a single team, you may need to perform project planning and build out a full project plan incorporating the five project management process groups. This includes identifying budgets to cover costs like training and any additional resource requirements needed to execute the changes.

Step 4: Test the changes

It’s time to evaluate how the new procedure unfolds in real life. Because modifying a process can cause delays or increase costs in the short term while staff get up to speed with the changes, it’s best to test the process improvements with a handful of participants before rolling it out to an entire team or across the organization.

Typically, the stakeholders who were actively involved in creating a new procedure would also be the ones testing the changes. Once the tests are completed and results prove the new procedure resolves issues and creates meaningful, measurable improvement, the new process can be implemented across the organization. Depending on the extent of the changes, project integration management may be necessary.

Tips for testing the changes:

When it comes to the test phase, follow these suggestions to bring a process change to the point where it’s ready for a full rollout.

Take time testing: Be sure your testing is thorough. It should include all common scenarios for the given workflow. Also, use a large enough sample size of test cases to catch issues with the new process. It’s not enough to test a scenario once, so be prepared to run through the changes multiple times to ensure you’re seeing consistent results every time.

It’s not enough to test a scenario once, so be prepared to run through the changes multiple times to ensure you’re seeing consistent results every time. Compile feedback: Collect feedback throughout the testing phase to determine where further improvements can be made. It’s rare to create a flawless new process, so this feedback allows adjustments to happen quickly so that the new process can be fine tuned and ready to roll out to the broader team or to customers.

Step 5: Monitor and optimize

Even after thorough testing, process improvements require daily monitoring in the early weeks of a rollout to catch any issues that may have been missed during the test phase. Also, it’s an opportunity to see how the new changes can be further enhanced.

The monitoring should compare the results of the improved process against the goals identified at the start of the project. You should also use the outcomes derived under the old procedure as a sounding board to validate the changes are truly an improvement.

As part of the monitoring phase, look for ways to further improve the updated workflow. This optimization means circling back through the process improvement exercise, but additional enhancement opportunities should be fewer than the first round of changes, allowing subsequent iterations to move quickly. Repeat this cycle of continuous optimization until you’ve met or exceeded all benchmarks for the process.

Tips for monitoring and optimizing:

Once the process improvements are rolled out, your work is not done. Check out these tips to get the most out of the monitoring and optimization phase.

Collect more feedback: Continue to collect feedback from stakeholders, especially now that the process changes are live across the organization. You’ll have a broader group of participants to more comprehensively assess how the revised process is working. In addition, be sure to use data analysis in your monitoring and optimization efforts so you can not only review measurable outcomes but also share these results with stakeholders.

You’ll have a broader group of participants to more comprehensively assess how the revised process is working. In addition, be sure to use data analysis in your monitoring and optimization efforts so you can not only review measurable outcomes but also share these results with stakeholders. Keep improving: Even after you’ve achieved all objectives for the new process, consider how you can continue to drive your company’s operational excellence further. Like Amazon’s push from two-day delivery to one, look through the lens of the customer experience to identify how you can do more. Here, gap analysis provides an ideal framework for evolving your operations.

Final advice about process improvements

Once you improve processes, the reality is that they must be revisited again in the future. Business goals, market forces, and new technologies evolve, making established procedures inefficient or obsolete.

Rather than execute a big project whenever a change is required, adopt an approach of small, iterative improvements that happen routinely over time. This continuous improvement cycle is an approach most organizations naturally perform such as when team members make minor procedural adjustments to increase efficiency.

The difference is that you’re implementing a framework that makes process improvement a conscious part of the company’s DNA. That’s when you’re able to deliver operational excellence that keeps evolving to stay ahead of competitors and deliver a superior experience to your customers.
Answer: After testing your improvement suggestion for a month, you can prove your processes are efficient by comparing the results of the improved process against the quantifiable goals set at the start of the project. Additionally, you should compare the outcomes derived under the new process with those from the old procedure to validate that the changes are truly an improvement. Collect feedback from stakeholders and use data analysis to review measurable outcomes, ensuring that the new process meets or exceeds all benchmarks for efficiency, productivity, and quality.

Here are tips to overcome this hurdle.\\n\\nExplain the rationale: People are naturally resistant to change, even if it’s for the better.

Moreover, by detailing how the changes will deliver value, such as a better customer experience, stakeholders become motivated to help you.\\n\\nPeople are naturally resistant to change, even if it’s for the better. That’s why you must explain the reasons behind the process improvements to obtain buy-in. Moreover, by detailing how the changes will deliver value, such as a better customer experience, stakeholders become motivated to help you. Clarify roles: Stakeholders hold varying degrees of involvement in process changes. As a result, ensure every stakeholder is clear on their role in the business process improvement plan. For example, some people may be directly involved in executing process changes while others are indirectly affected by it, and hence, do not take an active role in the implementation. So for those directly involved, they must carve out time to help transition to new processes.\\n\\nStep 3: Design the process improvement plan\\n\\nOutlining the process improvements takes place at this stage. Bring together the information gathered in the first step with the stakeholders identified in the second step as taking an active role in the process to form a plan.\\n\\nDetermining the changes required to improve a process isn’t the only component in the plan. You and your team must also decide how you will measure the effectiveness of the changes, evaluate any risks, and identify how the changes will affect the customer experience.\\n\\nOnce all of these elements have been vetted and a course of action determined, any previous process mapping can be revised to lay out the new process, and used as a tool to create training materials.\\n\\nTips for designing the process improvement plan:\\n\\nKeep these tips in mind when outlining the changes required to improve a process.\\n\\nStandardize the process: Ensure your plan objective is to develop a standardized process. A new procedure must create uniformity. Doing so improves both productivity and quality as well as making sure predictable outcomes are achieved. Here, introducing a technical solution to streamline the workflow helps, particularly if the solution automates many of the process steps.\\n\\nCreate a project plan: Transforming processes impacts an organization to varying degrees depending on the extent of the changes. If the process improvement is larger than small adjustments affecting a single team, you may need to perform project planning and build out a full project plan incorporating the five project management process groups. This includes identifying budgets to cover costs like training and any additional resource requirements needed to execute the changes.\\n\\nStep 4: Test the changes\\n\\nIt’s time to evaluate how the new procedure unfolds in real life. Because modifying a process can cause delays or increase costs in the short term while staff get up to speed with the changes, it’s best to test the process improvements with a handful of participants before rolling it out to an entire team or across the organization.\\n\\nTypically, the stakeholders who were actively involved in creating a new procedure would also be the ones testing the changes. Once the tests are completed and results prove the new procedure resolves issues and creates meaningful, measurable improvement, the new process can be implemented across the organization. Depending on the extent of the changes, project integration management may be necessary.\\n\\nTips for testing the changes:\\n\\nWhen it comes to the test phase, follow these suggestions to bring a process change to the point where it’s ready for a full rollout.\\n\\nTake time testing: Be sure your testing is thorough. It should include all common scenarios for the given workflow. Also, use a large enough sample size of test cases to catch issues with the new process. It’s not enough to test a scenario once, so be prepared to run through the changes multiple times to ensure you’re seeing consistent results every time.\\n\\nBe sure your testing is thorough. It should include all common scenarios for the given workflow. Also, use a large enough sample size of test cases to catch issues with the new process. It’s not enough to test a scenario once, so be prepared to run through the changes multiple times to ensure you’re seeing consistent results every time. Compile feedback: Collect feedback throughout the testing phase to determine where further improvements can be made. It’s rare to create a flawless new process, so this feedback allows adjustments to happen quickly so that the new process can be fine tuned and ready to roll out to the broader team or to customers.\\n\\nStep 5: Monitor and optimize\\n\\nEven after thorough testing, process improvements require daily monitoring in the early weeks of a rollout to catch any issues that may have been missed during the test phase. Also, it’s an opportunity to see how the new changes can be further enhanced.\\n\\nThe monitoring should compare the results of the improved process against the goals identified at the start of the project. You should also use the outcomes derived under the old procedure as a sounding board to validate the changes are truly an improvement.\\n\\nAs part of the monitoring phase, look for ways to further improve the updated workflow. This optimization means circling back through the process improvement exercise, but additional enhancement opportunities should be fewer than the first round of changes, allowing subsequent iterations to move quickly. Repeat this cycle of continuous optimization until you’ve met or exceeded all benchmarks for the process.\\n\\nTips for monitoring and optimizing:\\n\\nOnce the process improvements are rolled out, your work is not done. Check out these tips to get the most out of the monitoring and optimization phase.\\n\\nCollect more feedback: Continue to collect feedback from stakeholders, especially now that the process changes are live across the organization. You’ll have a broader group of participants to more comprehensively assess how the revised process is working. In addition, be sure to use data analysis in your monitoring and optimization efforts so you can not only review measurable outcomes but also share these results with stakeholders.\\n\\nContinue to collect feedback from stakeholders, especially now that the process changes are live across the organization.

In addition, be sure to use data analysis in your monitoring and optimization efforts so you can not only review measurable outcomes but also share these results with stakeholders. Keep improving: Even after you’ve achieved all objectives for the new process, consider how you can continue to drive your company’s operational excellence further. Like Amazon’s push from two-day delivery to one, look through the lens of the customer experience to identify how you can do more. Here, gap analysis provides an ideal framework for evolving your operations.\\n\\nFinal advice about process improvements\\n\\nOnce you improve processes, the reality is that they must be revisited again in the future. Business goals, market forces, and new technologies evolve, making established procedures inefficient or obsolete.\\n\\nRather than execute a big project whenever a change is required, adopt an approach of small, iterative improvements that happen routinely over time. This continuous improvement cycle is an approach most organizations naturally perform such as when team members make minor procedural adjustments to increase efficiency.\\n\\nThe difference is that you’re implementing a framework that makes process improvement a conscious part of the company’s DNA.

Answer: To prove that your processes are efficient after testing your improvement suggestion for a month, you should monitor and compare the results of the improved process against the goals identified at the start of the project. Use the outcomes derived under the old procedure as a benchmark to validate that the changes are truly an improvement. Collect feedback from stakeholders and use data analysis to review measurable outcomes. This will help you assess how the revised process is working and share these results with stakeholders. Additionally, look for ways to further optimize the updated workflow by identifying any additional enhancement opportunities.

Context: What is California Doing To Prevent Massive Earthquake Damage?

House Bolting Los Angeles

Many terrifying scenes how many sections of Mexico got hit with massive earthquake damage. Entire sections of office buildings fell, and many people were there to capture the moment. The residents in mexico frightened with fear captured the moments through their cellphone videos; a number of buildings, apartments, and schools that collapsing during these last big earthquakes that hit New Mexico and Oaxaca. This is a big warning to many people that are living in areas where earthquakes hit (Im talking about Los Angeles). Like every 20-25 years, Los Angeles has been hit by major earthquakes, it has been 23 years since the 6.7 magnitude hit Northridge in 94’. In 2008, the US Geological Survey found that there is a greater that 99% of a 6.7 magnitude earthquake or larger hitting California are over the next 30 years. California’s infrastructure could be crippled for weeks if not months.

So what is the city of Angels doing to prevent enormous earthquake damage? The city of LA enacted the nation’s most sweeping seismic regulations, requiring around 14,000 buildings and homes to be retrofitted so they can withstand a massive quake.

House bolting thick steel columns will help for the columns to not buckle in case of a massive quake. The steel beam goes 5 feet underground, and an additional 2 feed under concrete. This can help from the house to not collapse during an earthquake. This rule is not only implemented in Los Angeles; it is also mandatory in San Francisco. House bolting these buildings will substantially improve the collapse rate in San Francisco.

We might have an earthquake early warning system that will let us know maybe seconds or minutes before an earthquake occurs-but it can’t ever prepare us for buildings that need the support foundation to withstand a big one. California cities know that the state is vulnerable for earthquakes, it is ultimately up to us to make sure we protect our homes and our families from major damage. House bolting is a requirement, don’t let this chance of saving your home pass you by. Call today for you initial retrofit inspection.
In California, many buildings remain vulnerable to earthquake damage

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

After the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, many of the people who died or were severely injured were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. A number of those structures were built a long time ago, and even some of the more recently built ones were not up to code - factors that experts say likely contributed to the soaring death toll. The disaster in Turkey and Syria has triggered concerns in other disaster-prone areas of the world, including here in the U.S.

Jacob Margolis is a reporter for LAist news, and he's here to tell us more about why California, especially, is on alert. Hey, Jacob.

JACOB MARGOLIS, BYLINE: Hey.

CHANG: OK. So before we talk about the problems facing us here in California, what is it about the construction of many of these buildings in Turkey and Syria that collapsed that experts think made those buildings especially vulnerable to earthquake damage?

MARGOLIS: Yeah. It seems that many of the buildings that collapsed were concrete structures that didn't have adequate reinforcement to help them deal with ground motions that were really extreme. We're talking a velocity of - I think it's about three feet a second, which is huge. It's still being investigated, but it will likely be found that some of the structures, they didn't have proper rebar or concrete or even wall-to-floor connections so that when the ground moved that violently, columns collapsed, and then there's nothing holding the big, heavy floors up. And then the rest of the building comes down following it.

Now, like, I want to note - and people should note - Turkey has building codes on par with California and Japan, according to different engineers that I've spoken with. So the question is, like, why did the buildings collapse? And that's all being sorted. I know there's a delegation of engineers heading over to do some assessments, including from the U.S., and we'll learn more once things settle down.

CHANG: Right. But do you have a sense right now of how common those structural vulnerabilities that you've described in concrete buildings in Turkey and Syria - how common those are in California buildings?

MARGOLIS: Yeah. We have a lot of concrete buildings here in California that we know could very well collapse in a big earthquake. Anyone who thinks it's not going to happen or that it couldn't happen is delusional. I mean, we have, for instance, in Los Angeles, a program that is specifically meant for a type of concrete building built prior to the late 1970s that is saying, hey, you need to retrofit these buildings. But the timeline is like 25-plus years probably. Just to put it in perspective, there's a 15% chance that we're going to get hit here in Southern California with a 7.8 magnitude or greater quake sometime in the next 30 years.

CHANG: Right.

MARGOLIS: And so we have a lower concentration of those types of concrete buildings here. And that's one thing that we actually have working for us is that we've got a lot of sprawl, especially here in Southern California, where I am - a lot of single-family, wood-frame homes. And those do pretty well in earthquakes, and they're much easier to retrofit than the big, concrete buildings as well.

CHANG: Well, if experts know that there are these deeply concerning structural weaknesses in so many buildings in California and we are expecting the so-called big one someday here in the state, why haven't these buildings been brought up to code? Like, why are they given so much time to get up to code? What are the challenges?

MARGOLIS: Yeah. So for bigger buildings, retrofits can be extremely expensive. They take a lot of time. And whether we demand those retrofits happen faster is kind of up to, you know, city officials and the public because they do take a lot of money as well.

CHANG: Yeah, a lot of money and a lot of time. Well then, I mean, practically speaking, for the average person, what are, like, next steps people can take if they live or work in a building that they think might not be structurally sound given everything that we've talked about? I mean, what can people actually do?

MARGOLIS: You know, find out if the building has been retrofitted here in Los Angeles. There's a website that you can search to tell you when it was built and if it has been retrofitted. For a lot of other cities, municipalities across the state, I don't think that's necessarily the case. So if it was built prior to the late-1970s and it's a concrete structure, just know that there is a possibility that it could come down in the next big quake.

CHANG: That is Jacob Margolis of LAist news. Thank you so much, Jacob.

MARGOLIS: Thank you.

Answer: To minimize downtime in buildings located in California due to destructive strong ground motion, you could implement the following strategies:

1. **Retrofitting**: Ensure that buildings, especially those built prior to the late 1970s, are retrofitted to withstand earthquakes. This includes reinforcing concrete structures with proper rebar and ensuring adequate wall-to-floor connections.

2. **House Bolting**: Implement house bolting techniques, which involve securing buildings to their foundations using thick steel columns that extend underground. This helps prevent buildings from collapsing during an earthquake.

3. **Compliance with Seismic Regulations**: Adhere to the seismic regulations enacted by cities like Los Angeles, which require retrofitting of vulnerable buildings to improve their resilience against earthquakes.

4. **Regular Inspections**: Conduct regular inspections to assess the structural integrity of buildings and identify any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.

5. **Emergency Preparedness**: Develop and maintain an earthquake emergency preparedness plan, including evacuation routes and safety protocols, to ensure the safety of occupants and minimize disruption.

6. **Early Warning Systems**: Utilize earthquake early warning systems to provide advance notice of an impending earthquake, allowing for timely implementation of safety measures.

By implementing these strategies, you can enhance the resilience of buildings in California and reduce downtime following an earthquake.

 How To Apply The Spacing Effect In Your eLearning Course DesignThe spacing effect was first introduced by Hermann Ebbinghaus back in 1885. It suggests that learning is a gradual process that should be spaced out over a length of time, instead of trying to flood learners' synapses with an abundance of information all at once. As such, applied to eLearning, online learners are able to commit knowledge to long-term memory, thereby beating the forgetting curve and enhancing the benefits of the eLearning course. Here are 8 tips to use the spacing effect to your advantage in eLearning.1. Reinforce Key Concepts With Real-World ActivitiesThe human brain absorbs information more effectively when it's practical and contextual.

 When judging the heaviness of two objects with equal mass, people perceive the smaller and denser of the two as being heavier. Despite the large number of theories, covering bottom-up and top-down approaches, none of them can fully account for all aspects of this size-weight illusion and thus for human heaviness perception. Here we propose a new maximum-likelihood estimation model which describes the illusion as the weighted average of two heaviness estimates with correlated noise: One estimate derived from the object’s mass, and the other from the object’s density, with estimates’ weights based on their relative reliabilities. While information about mass can directly be perceived, information about density will in some cases first have to be derived from mass and volume. However, according to our model at the crucial perceptual level, heaviness judgments will be biased by the objects’ density, not by its size.

Using a series of behavioral experiments, we demonstrated this optimal computational framework well describes human perception ( Peters, Ma & Shams, 2016 ).Until recently, however, there remained a class of weight-related visuo-haptic illusions that appeared to defy optimality ( Buckingham, 2014 ), calling into question whether human perception is in fact mathematically optimal. Two such illusions are the size-weight illusion (SWI), in which the smaller of two equal-mass objects is perceived as feeling heavier ( Murray et al., 1999 ), and the material-weight illusion (MWI), in which an object appearing to be made of a denser material is perceived as feeling
Answer: The most recent models of the size-weight illusion propose that the illusion is a result of a maximum-likelihood estimation process. This model suggests that the perception of heaviness is the weighted average of two heaviness estimates with correlated noise: one derived from the object's mass and the other from its density. The weights of these estimates are based on their relative reliabilities. While mass information can be directly perceived, density information may need to be derived from mass and volume. The model posits that at the perceptual level, heaviness judgments are biased by the object's density rather than its size. This approach aligns with the idea that the smaller item is perceived as denser and therefore feels heavier, which is supported by behavioral experiments demonstrating this optimal computational framework. However, there are still visuo-haptic illusions, like the size-weight illusion, that challenge the notion of mathematically optimal human perception.

Answer: Recent models of the size-weight illusion focus on the perception of heaviness when comparing two objects of equal mass. One proposed model is a maximum-likelihood estimation model, which describes the illusion as the weighted average of two heaviness estimates with correlated noise. These estimates are derived from the object's mass and density, with their weights based on relative reliabilities. The model suggests that while mass can be directly perceived, density may need to be inferred from mass and volume. At the perceptual level, heaviness judgments are biased by the object's density rather than its size.

Another approach involves an optimal computational framework that accounts for the perception of the smaller item as denser, leading to the perception that it feels heavier. This framework has been supported by behavioral experiments and suggests that human perception can be mathematically optimal, although some visuo-haptic illusions, like the size-weight illusion, challenge this notion.

Answer: To build a portfolio, consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes. This means including a mix of securities such as stocks, bonds, and cash. Diversification helps spread risks and reduces the impact of poor returns from any single investment on your overall portfolio. Stocks generally offer the greatest returns but come with higher risk, while bonds provide moderate returns with less risk, and cash or cash equivalents are the least risky but also offer the least return. By balancing these asset classes, you can create a portfolio that is less volatile and better suited to your financial goals.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================

When most people think of climate change, they think of rising sea levels and more intense heat waves. Engineers like Colorado State University's Hussam Mahmoud think of bridges.

The associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering is studying the toll climate change may take on aging U.S. infrastructure, which includes over 600,000 bridges. Now, he is co-author of a new study linking the potential impacts of climate change with the structural integrity of thousands of bridges transecting America's highways and towns. Mahmoud's analysis demonstrates a need to rethink the nation's priority order of bridge repair, as climate change looms and infrastructure funding remains limited.

The research is published Oct. 23 in PLOS ONE, and its lead author is Susan Palu, who recently graduated from CSU with a master's degree in civil engineering.

Mahmoud and Palu focused their analysis on about 80,000 "simply supported steel girder bridges," a design common since World War II that consists of longitudinal beams spanning two piers. These bridges suffer frequently from expansion joints clogging with debris and require regular maintenance to clean the joints. Expansion joints connect bridge spans and allow the structure to expand and contract as the air heats or cools.

When joints become clogged, they prevent the bridge from expanding normally in response to higher temperatures. The researchers reasoned that higher average temperatures in the future, not accounted for when such bridges were first built, could lead to unpredicted thermal stress. Heat stress can cause buckling and cracking, which are exacerbated by both bending from the weight of trucks and cars, and axial loading from the expansion restriction. The researchers' study is the first to quantify the impact of potential temperature changes in conjunction with normal expected clogging of expansion joints.

The researchers considered four different seasonal scenarios for temperature at the time of each bridge's construction, along with projected average temperatures for the years 2040, 2060, 2080 and 2100. The projected temperature rises are the "radiative concentration pathway" greenhouse gas warming scenarios adopted by the International Panel on Climate Change in 2014.

Results indicate that bridges located in the northern portion of the United States, including the Northern Rockies and Plains, Northwest and Upper Midwest, are the most vulnerable to more pronounced increases in temperatures. Less susceptible regions were the Southeast and Northeast.

The engineers' aim was to rank bridges in order of needed maintenance after accounting for the new normal of climate change.

"We as engineers must start to look beyond what we have initially been taught on how to analyze systems and start to think about what climate change is going to do to our understanding of component-level behavior and system-level performance," Mahmoud said.

Answer: The key maintenance and upkeep issues for bridges, especially those exposed to extreme climatic conditions, include:

1. **Expansion Joint Clogging**: Bridges, particularly simply supported steel girder bridges, suffer from expansion joints clogging with debris. These joints are crucial as they allow the bridge to expand and contract with temperature changes. When clogged, they prevent normal expansion, leading to thermal stress.

2. **Thermal Stress**: Higher average temperatures, which were not accounted for when many bridges were initially built, can lead to unpredicted thermal stress. This stress can cause buckling and cracking, exacerbated by the weight of vehicles and axial loading from restricted expansion.

3. **Corrosion**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, bridges exposed to seawater are typically at risk of corrosion, which can weaken structural integrity over time.

These issues highlight the need for regular maintenance, such as cleaning expansion joints and monitoring for signs of thermal stress and corrosion, to ensure the structural integrity of bridges, especially in regions experiencing significant temperature increases or exposure to corrosive environments.

Answer: Proteins that are prone to form inclusion bodies when expressed in a heterologous system often have properties such as high-level expression, non-native sequences, hydrophobic regions, and the presence of disulfide bonds. These characteristics can lead to the intracellular accumulation of folded expressed proteins, which aggregate through non-covalent hydrophobic or ionic interactions. The reducing environment of bacterial cytosol, for example, can inhibit proper disulfide bond formation, further promoting aggregation into inclusion bodies.

What to Do If Your Dog Has Separation Anxiety

Treatment for Mild Separation Anxiety

If your dog has a mild case of separation anxiety, counterconditioning might reduce or resolve the problem. Counterconditioning is a treatment process that changes an animal’s fearful, anxious or aggressive reaction to a pleasant, relaxed one instead. It’s done by associating the sight or presence of a feared or disliked person, animal, place, object or situation with something really good, something the dog loves.

Answer: To address the separation anxiety disorder in your dog, you should consider a combination of desensitization and counterconditioning techniques. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Desensitization Process**: 
   - Practice sit-stay or down-stay exercises using positive reinforcement. Gradually increase the distance you move away from your dog, aiming to move briefly out of your dog's sight while he remains in the "stay" position. This helps teach your dog to remain calm and happy in one place while you go to another.

2. **Counterconditioning**:
   - Develop an association between being alone and good things. Every time you leave the house, offer your dog a puzzle toy stuffed with food. This helps change your dog's anxious reaction to being alone into a more relaxed one by associating your departure with something positive.

3. **Professional Help**:
   - For more severe cases, it is recommended to seek professional help to guide you through the process and ensure the techniques are applied effectively.

By combining these methods, you can help reduce or resolve your dog's separation anxiety symptoms.

GraphRAG Score: 50Question: It is known that Christopher Columbus discovered America. In this scenario, to what extent do you believe that he provoked the killings of thousands of indigenous people?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: CNN —

“In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.”

That rhyme has long been how American students were introduced to Christopher Columbus in elementary school.

Students are taught that Columbus is the one who discovered the Americas, sailing across the Atlantic in his three ships: The Niña, Pinta and Santa Maria. The Italian explorer is even celebrated every October during a federal holiday named after him.

But the man credited for discovering the “New World” has long been considered a contentious figure in US history for his treatment of the indigenous communities he encountered and for his role in the violent colonization at their expense.

Dozens of cities and states – such as Minnesota, Alaska, Vermont and Oregon – have already replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous People’s Day.

Now, in response to the nationwide protests and conversation surrounding racial inequality, people have been tearing down statues of Columbus to bring awareness to the cruelty he brought upon indigenous people.

So what did Columbus really do and why is he being labeled as a “tyrant” rather than the hero we were taught to believe?

“We should question why we as Americans continue to celebrate him without knowing the true history of his legacy, and why a holiday was created in the first place,” Dr. Leo Killsback, a citizen of the Northern Cheyenne Nation and assistant professor of American Indian Studies at Arizona State University, told CNN in 2016.

He wasn’t the first to discover the Americas

There’s no doubt that Columbus’ voyages had an “undeniable historical impact, sparking the great age of Atlantic exploration, trade and eventually colonization by Europeans,” according to historian David M. Perry, who wrote an op-ed for CNN about Columbus Day in 2015.

But Columbus wasn’t the first to discover the New World. Indigenous people had been living there for centuries by the time he arrived in 1492 and Leif Eriksson and the Vikings beat him to it five centuries earlier.

He enslaved the natives

During his voyages through the Caribbean islands and the Central and South American coasts, Columbus came upon indigenous people that he labeled “Indians.”

Columbus and his men enslaved many of these native people and treated them with extreme violence and brutality, according to History.com.

Throughout his years in the Americas, Columbus forced natives to work for the sake of profits. Later, he sent thousands of Taino “Indians” to Spain to be sold, and many of them died during the journey. The natives who weren’t sold into slavery were forced to look for gold in mines and work on plantations.

While he was governor of what is now the Dominican Republic, Columbus killed many natives in response to their revolt, according to History.com. To prevent further rebellion, he would have the dead bodies paraded through the streets.

He brought new diseases

The indigenous societies of the Americas “were decimated by exposure to Old World diseases, crumbling under the weight of epidemic,” Perry wrote in his CNN op-ed.

The Taino population weren’t immune to diseases such as smallpox, measles and influenza, which were brought to their island of Hispaniola by Columbus and his men. In 1492, there were an estimated 250,000 indigenous people in Hispaniola, but by 1517, only 14,000 remained, according to the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation.

Some historians believe that the impact of European and African settlers in the New World possibly killed as much as 90% of the native populations and was deadlier than the Black Death was in medieval Europe, OMRF said.
Indigenous communities have been persecuted in the Americas since Christopher Columbus first came ashore on the island of Guanahani in the present-day Bahamas 528 years ago.

They have had their land stolen, people slaughtered, enslaved, and infected with diseases, women raped, children kidnapped, treaties broken, and possessions and goods plundered and looted.

There were between 5 million and 15 million Indigenous people living in North America in 1492. By the late 1800s, there were fewer than 238,000 left.

The so-called “Age of Discovery” has begot centuries of genocide.

Crashing to the ground alongside statues and monuments of slaveowners and Confederate generals, during the nationwide anti-racism and police brutality protests over the summer in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, were statues of Columbus. In several instances, Indigenous people participated in their removal.

A 10-foot bronze statue of Columbus in St. Paul, Minnesota, not far from where Floyd was killed, was toppled in June by protesters, who tied ropes around its neck and yanked it from its pedestal. Members of the American Indian Movement were among the demonstrators, and danced and sang around the fallen icon.

In a show of support for Indigenous communities, anti-racist activists, carrying signs reading “This land is Powhatan land” and “Columbus represents genocide,” pulled down a Columbus statue in Richmond, Virginia, and threw it into a lake. Members of the Richmond Indigenous Society took part in the June rally.

All of Southeastern Pennsylvania and South Jersey inhabit Indigenous land, that of the Lenape people. Penn is home to a small but proud and passionate Indigenous community, which has existed since two Mohawk brothers, Jonathan and Philip Gayienquitioga, attended the Academy of Philadelphia in 1755.

Penn Today spoke with members of this community about their views on Christopher Columbus, and the suffering of Indigenous people under colonialism.

Unlearning Columbus

Indigenous peoples populated the land now called the United States for more than 15,000 years before the arrival of Christopher Columbus, but most American schools teach that Columbus “discovered” America—despite the fact that he never set foot on its soil.

That dichotomy has never sat well with Connor Beard, a senior in the College of Arts & Sciences, co-chair of Natives at Penn, and one of the 55,000 members of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. In elementary school in Warren, New Jersey, he was taught the “Columbus discovered America” version of American history, which he says conflicted with what he was taught at home. He recalls an exam in eighth grade in which he was asked a true or false question about whether Columbus discovered America.

According to his teacher, the answer was true, but Beard says he knew that responding true was not an accurate representation of historical events.

“It was difficult because I felt like I was in a weird position where I kind of had to agree with it in order to do well in that environment,” he says. “I think it’s a false idea that he discovered America because you can’t discover a place where there’s already people there.”

As he educated himself further about Columbus and the atrocities he committed against Indigenous people, Beard says he became even more horrified.

While serving as the governor of Hispaniola, present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic, Columbus punished people by cutting of their ears and noses, and paraded women naked through the streets and sold them into slavery.

Together with Columbus Day, a number of U.S. cities celebrate Indigenous People’s Day on the second Monday in October, or have abolished Columbus Day altogether.

Beard says the Columbus Day holiday should be eliminated.

“I think on a basic level, if you are going to celebrate whoever came to America first, you might as well celebrate the Indigenous people who were here first,” he says.

Unworthy of praise

Brooke Parmalee, a second-year student at Penn Law School, graduate co-chair of Natives at Penn, and a member of the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation in Connecticut, says the glorification of Christopher Columbus is disturbing, and the destructive effects of the colonial era he ushered in continue to harm Indigenous communities to this very day.

“It’s frustrating to put him as discovering America when he discovered land where Natives were here hundreds of years before he was,” she says. “And beyond that, he enslaved and devastated the Native population. Hundreds of thousands of Natives were enslaved and killed due to his discovery process.”

Her 300-member tribe, based on a 400-acre reservation in Kent, about 50 miles west of Hartford, is fighting the federal government for recognition and the state of Connecticut for the return of their land. They were first documented as an Indigenous community within the Connecticut Colony’s Housatonic Valley in the 1600s. During King Philip’s War—an armed conflict in southern New England from 1675-1676 that pitted Indigenous tribes against marauding English colonists trying to take their land—the area served as a refuge for Eastern Indigenous peoples fleeing the hostilities.

Parmalee, who grew up close to the reservation, says most of the members of her tribe were removed from their land under duress and forced to assimilate. Her great-great grandmother, a dark-skinned Indigenous woman, was told that she was too dark to live in the area of Kent and sent to Bridgeport, Connecticut.

“The land we originally had as ours was a lot bigger than what we have now,” she says. “The reservation we have left is a very small piece of the land we used to own.”

Parmalee was inspired to go to law school in order to acquire the skills, knowledge, and expertise to help her tribe fight for federal recognition, land, compensation, and justice, and other tribes as well.

She celebrates the second Monday in October as Indigenous People’s Day.

“By honoring Christopher Columbus or glorifying this man, it’s the complete opposite of facts,” she says.

Trauma passed down through generations

In 1779, while he was fighting a war of independence to free the fledgling United States from British rule, George Washington, then commander in chief of the Continental Army, waged a concurrent war to subjugate and destroy the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in central New York. Also called the Iroquois or Six Nation Confederacy, the union consists of the Onondaga, Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora nations.

U.S. forces under Colonel Goose Van Schaick brutally attacked Onondaga towns in April of 1779, burning more than eight miles of Onondaga villages and crops, and killing men, women, and children.

Wharton sophomore Lauren McDonald, a South Florida native and member of Onondaga Nation, says assaults such as Van Schaick’s and numerous other colonial atrocities have caused “generational trauma” among Indigenous communities: psychological and emotional pain and anguish that is passed down from one generation to another, great-grandparents to grandparents, parents to children, children to grandchildren.

“I think with every new generation, [generational trauma] just gives them something else to work on, or work past, or work through,” she says, “a lot these things that other people in the community have been feeling. For example, for Columbus Day and all of these things that other people celebrate, I think for a lot of Indigenous people in the community, it’s something that affects their identity and affects who they are. It also brings a lot of negative attitudes towards them.”

McDonald does not acknowledge Columbus Day. She is leading a Natives at Penn initiative to have the University recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day, and is working with her Indigenous classmates to bring more visibility and resources to Indigenous students.

The silencing of Indigenous voices

Américo Mendoza-Mori, a lecturer in the Department of Hispanic and Portuguese Studies in the School of Arts & Sciences who teaches Quechua and Spanish, says the debate surrounding the veneration of Christopher Columbus and the rejection of him by Indigenous communities is about more than just statues, holidays, or Columbus himself, it’s about what he symbolizes—the elimination of Indigenous peoples from history and the national narrative, and the silencing of their voice and value.

“In the United States, we emphasize that we are a nation of immigrants, and of course, that’s a true fact, but unconsciously, even if we say it with good will, we are erasing from that vision all of the Native communities,” he says.

Mendoza-Mori, who also designed the Quechua Language Program, says current discussions about the place of Columbus in our society should focus more on drawing attention to the absence and exclusion of Indigenous viewpoints and voices, and highlight the presence, legacy, and importance of the Indigenous communities in the history of the Americas and in the present day.

He cites conversations about climate change as an example of where Indigenous voices are neglected. Indigenous communities, he says, have been active and engaged around the issue, and around 60 percent of the world’s most environmentally vulnerable locations are in Indigenous areas, but in most cases, their input is not sought when climate change and other global issues are being discussed.

“We learn about Indigeneity, or Indigenous culture or Native culture, as something from the past,” he says. “We never think necessarily about them as something from the present. And because we see them as something from the past, we don’t even think about the knowledge or the conversations they could bring to the table.”
Answer: Christopher Columbus is credited with discovering the Americas, but his arrival and subsequent actions had devastating consequences for the indigenous populations. Columbus and his men enslaved many indigenous people, treated them with extreme violence and brutality, and forced them to work for profits. He also sent thousands of Taino "Indians" to Spain to be sold, with many dying during the journey. Those who weren't sold into slavery were forced to search for gold and work on plantations. Additionally, Columbus's arrival brought Old World diseases to the indigenous populations, leading to massive population declines. The Taino population, for example, dropped from an estimated 250,000 in 1492 to only 14,000 by 1517 due to diseases like smallpox, measles, and influenza. These actions and their consequences contributed significantly to the deaths and suffering of thousands of indigenous people.

Answer: Christopher Columbus is often credited with discovering America, but this narrative overlooks the fact that indigenous people had been living in the Americas for centuries before his arrival. Columbus's voyages marked the beginning of European colonization, which had devastating effects on indigenous populations. He and his men enslaved many native people, treated them with extreme violence, and brought diseases to which the indigenous populations had no immunity. These actions led to the deaths of thousands of indigenous people. Columbus's role in the violent colonization and exploitation of indigenous communities has led to him being labeled as a "tyrant" rather than a hero. The impact of European and African settlers in the New World possibly killed as much as 90% of the native populations, making it deadlier than the Black Death in medieval Europe.

Paying for College A college degree opens windows of opportunity, but paying for a college education can be costly. Public community colleges with open admissions are relatively inexpensive when compared to highly selective private universities, but tuition and fees can add up quickly at any school. Student loans are often given a bad reputation by the media, but they are a form of financial aid that helps many students get through college. However, loans are not the only way to pay for college. Many students are eligible for need-based grants or merit-based scholarships. Work-study and tuition payment plans are also options. If you know where to look and who to ask, financial assistance to help with paying for college is out there.

Common College Courses Whether you major in accounting or zoology, there are some common college courses that will eventually wind up in your class schedule. General education requirements usually include basic college courses in English, mathematics, the humanities, and more; learning the requirements at your school will help save time and effort if you take them early in your college career and get them out of the way. Transfer students will also benefit from information about common college courses. Credits earned for a class taken at one college or university may transfer to another school if the course was similar to the course that is required at the student’s new school.

Top Colleges by Major Although many college students begin their freshman year without declaring a major, other students have their hearts set on a particular career path from the beginning. Attending a college that offers the program you wish to study is of utmost importance. There is quite a difference between small liberal arts schools and large research universities! Unfortunately, the college that you attend may affect your job opportunities after graduation. School reputations do count in some fields. Several colleges and universities are world-renowned for their business or medical programs while others have highly acclaimed law schools or education departments. Annual college rankings are one way to find out about the top colleges by major, and speaking with recent alumni is another way to get first-hand knowledge of the quality of a particular school’s program. These articles about top colleges by major may also come in handy.

Tips for College Students The college application process can be a stressful event, but even students that are already enrolled in college can use some advice every now and then. It can be tough to juggle a full course load, work-study job and an active social life, especially if a pesky roommate or incredibly tough professor is thrown into the mix! Figuring out how to register for the right classes for your major or deciding which new computer to buy for school can get confusing, but helpful advice can make tough tasks seem much easier. From time management suggestions to advice on writing essays, these helpful tips for college students will definitely come in handy throughout the semester.

Answers to Your Questions about College What high school classes will help prepare you for college? Should you take the SAT or the ACT? Is it better to live at home and drive to school or live on campus in a dorm? What about online college? How can you find an awesome summer internship? The college years are supposed to be the best years of your life, but plenty of questions come up along the way! High school students that want to go to college will also have tons of questions, especially if they are the first member of their family to continue on with higher education. Taking the right courses during high school, figuring out how to apply to college, and choosing the right college for you can be a frustrating experience! Don’t be afraid to speak with your parents, teachers, guidance counselors, and school admissions counselors. You can even do some of your own research online, and these useful articles will help you find some answers to your questions about college.
Answer: The context provided does not directly address why a single grading system is used instead of different systems based on students' strengths and weaknesses. However, it does mention various aspects of education, such as individualized instruction, which suggests that there is an awareness of the need to cater to individual differences in learning. Individualized instruction involves tailoring the pace, method, and content to meet the needs of each student, which could imply a move towards more personalized assessment methods. However, the context does not provide a specific explanation for the use of a single grading system.

Answer: The Zeno's paradox of the arrow is not considered valid in the context of modern physics and mathematics. The paradox is resolved using contemporary theories of motion, particularly calculus, which defines instantaneous motion as being at different places at different times. This approach, developed by Newton and Leibniz, addresses the paradox by explaining motion without requiring it to be defined during an instant. Therefore, while the paradox is an interesting philosophical concept, it is not seen as a valid problem in the context of modern scientific understanding.

Answer: Zeno's arrow paradox is still a topic of philosophical discussion, but it has been addressed by modern physics and mathematics. The paradox suggests that an arrow in flight is motionless at any single instant in time, and therefore, it cannot be moving. However, the development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz provides a solution by defining motion as being at different places at different times, rather than at a single instant. This "at-at" theory of motion allows for the concept of instantaneous motion, resolving the paradox from a mathematical and physical perspective. While the paradox may still be valid as a philosophical question, it is not considered a problem in contemporary physics.

The country’s budget deficit is projected to increase to 1.4% of GDP this year and to 1.6% of GDP in 2020. The government debt was trimmed to 48.9% of GDP
Answer: If the EU no longer exists, it could have significant implications for Poland's economy. As the largest beneficiary of EU funds, with EUR 105.8 billion allocated between 2014 and 2020, Poland has relied heavily on these funds for investment in infrastructure, environmental and technology projects, and human and regional development. The absence of the EU would mean the loss of this substantial financial support, potentially hindering these areas of development.

Additionally, Poland's economic growth has been supported by strong domestic demand and exports, with over 50% of Polish exports being significant. The dissolution of the EU could disrupt trade relationships and market access, affecting Poland's export-driven economy. The potential increase in trade barriers and loss of the single market benefits could lead to economic challenges.

Furthermore, Poland's budget deficit and government debt levels, which have been managed within the EU framework, might face additional pressures without EU oversight and support. The projected increase in the budget deficit could be exacerbated by the loss of EU funds and economic uncertainties.

Overall, the absence of the EU would likely pose significant challenges to Poland's economic stability and growth prospects.

Answer: If the EU no longer exists, it could have significant implications for Poland's economy. As the largest beneficiary of EU funds, Poland has received substantial financial support for infrastructure, environmental, technology projects, and regional development. The absence of these funds could slow down or halt many ongoing and planned projects, potentially impacting economic growth and development.

Additionally, Poland's strong economic ties with other EU countries, including trade and investment, could be disrupted. The EU accounts for a significant portion of Poland's exports, and changes in trade agreements or tariffs could affect the competitiveness of Polish goods and services.

Moreover, the potential loss of access to the EU single market could lead to increased costs and barriers for Polish businesses operating in Europe. This could result in reduced foreign investment and economic uncertainty.

Overall, the dissolution of the EU would likely pose challenges to Poland's economic stability and growth, necessitating the development of new trade relationships and economic strategies.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: All used mice were aged between 10 and 18 weeks at the time of killing. All procedures were approved by Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were maintained under standard laboratory conditions with water and food freely available unless otherwise stated. Mice were housed on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with lights on at 07:00 and off at 19:00. All experimental groups within one experiment contained mice of same strain and sex, being similar in age and body weight, showing no difference in physical activity and feeding behaviour when assessed before drug injections. Starting at 13–14 weeks of age, body weights differed between wild-type and Cnr1−/− littermates. Animals from different experimental groups (vehicle versus drug treatment) were randomly allocated within the experimental order. After finishing experiments (data collection), each mouse ID was modified by a second investigator to blind the respective investigator who performed data analyses.

Mice

Pomc topaz (Pomc-GFP) transgenic mice were provided by J. Friedman and generated as described earlier48. The Npy-hrGFP line (strain B6.FVB-Tg (Npy-hrGFP) 1Lowl/J) and Pomc-Cre line (strain Tg (Pomc1-cre) 16Lowl/J) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Pomc-GFP and Npy-hrGFP lines are maintained on a C57BL6 background; the Pomc-Cre line is maintained on a mixed background in our laboratory. Note that Npy-hrGFP mice allow visualization of AgRP neurons through co-expression of NPY and AgRP in these cells. The first CB 1 R knockout (Cnr1−/−) line used here, as maintained in a C57BL6 background, was generated (sponsored by NIMH) and genotyped as previously described49. This line was used for feeding studies (Extended Data Fig. 1c) and ELISA experiments (Fig. 3b). For generation of the second Cnr1−/− line used here, mice bearing the transcription blocking cassette flanked by loxP sites upstream of the Cnr1 start codon (Cnr1+/TB-flox) were crossed with transgenic mice expressing Pomc-Cre. Offspring expressing Cnr1TB/+, Pomc-Cre were mated with Cnr1TB/+ to obtain littermate controls (wild-type; Pomc-Cre::Cnr1+/+ and Cnr1+/+), CB 1 R knockout controls (TB-CB 1 R; Cnr1TB/TB), and mice expressing CB 1 R only in POMC neurons (CB1RPOMC; Pomc-Cre::Cnr1TB/TB). These mice were used for specification of POMC CB 1 R expression and for validation of CB 1 R antibody specificity (Extended Data Fig. 5e). The original breeding pairs of the UCP2 knockout (Ucp2−/−) line were provided by B. Lowell and were generated as reported previously50. C57BL6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories.

Chemicals and antibodies

The selective CB 1 R agonist arachidonoyl 2-chloroethylamide (ACEA; Tocris Biosciences) was delivered pre-dissolved in ethanol (5 mg ml−1). For central injection of ACEA, ethanol was evaporated and ACEA was re-dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The CBR agonist WIN-55,212-2 mesylate (WIN) and the CB 1 R inverse agonist rimonabant (RIMO; Cayman Chemical Company) were dissolved in DMSO and aliquots were stored as a stock solution of 10 mg ml−1 at −80 °C for 3 months or less. At the day of use, ACEA, WIN or RIMO was mixed with a small drop of Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) before further dilution in saline and applied intraperitoneally to the animals. For the vehicle group, the same volume of ethanol or DMSO was applied compared to ACEA, WIN or RIMO. Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; Enzo Life Sciences) was dissolved in saline (5 mg ml−1) and stored at −80 °C until day of use. The μ-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (naloxone hydrochloride; Tocris Bioscience) was dissolved in saline (100 mg ml−1) and stored at −80 °C until day of use. Dihydroethidium (DHE; 10× 1 mg; Life Technologies) was stored light protected at −20 °C until use. Hoechst 33342 trihydrochloride, trihydrate (100 mg; Invitrogen) was stored light protected at 4 °C. Virus molecules (4 × 1012 per ml, dialysed in 350 mM NaCl plus 5% d-sorbitol in PBS) containing inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5/EF1α-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry) or stimulating DREADD (rAAV5/EF1α-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry) were purchased from Gene Therapy Center Vector Core. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C. The used primary and corresponding secondary antibodies were stored according to manufacturer’s instructions. Primary antibodies are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Immunofluorescence

After removal of food at 10:00, fed male mice were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle, WIN (1 mg kg−1 body weight) or ACEA (1 or 5 mg kg−1) for 90 min. Overnight fasted male mice were injected (intraperitoneally) with vehicle or RIMO (3 mg kg−1) at 10:00 for 90 min. Mice were then anaesthetized by isofluorane and killed by perfusion fixation (4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PBS), followed by overnight post-fixation in 4% PFA. After 30 min washing in PBS, brains were cut into 50-μm-thick sections, and 12 sections per mouse containing the ARC were collected. After 15 min in PBS, the sections were incubated in blocking solution (1:20 normal donkey serum in PBS (in case of CB 1 R staining using antisera derived from guinea-pig, 1:20 normal goat serum was used), containing 0.2% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies (see Supplementary Table 1) were then applied overnight at room temperature. The next day, sections were washed three times (5 min) in PBS and incubated with the respective secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (donkey anti-rabbit IgG fluor 488 or 568 (dilution 1:250, A-11008; or dilution 1:750, A-11036); donkey anti-sheep IgG fluor 488 (dilution 1:250, A-11015); goat anti-guinea-pig IgG fluor 488, 568 or 633 (dilution 1:250; A-11073; dilution 1:750, A-11075; or dilution 1:500, A-21105); goat anti-mouse fluor 633 (dilution 1:500; A-21052); Life Technologies). Finally, the sections were coverslipped. Double immunofluorescence labelling for cFOS and POMC in Pomc-Cre mice started with incubation of sections in blocking solution (see above). The anti-cFOS antibody was incubated at room temperature overnight. The next day, sections were incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:250; BA-1000, Vector Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated in avidin, conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (dilution 1:2,500, A-21370, Life Technologies) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated in unconjugated anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:25, 711-005-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with anti-POMC antibody overnight at room temperature. Finally, sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 633 (dilution 1:750, A-21070, Life Technologies) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Confocal laserscanning microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta, the confocal system equipped with helium neon lasers (543 and 633 nm excitation lines) and an argon laser (488 nm). Quantification of cFOS and pCREB immunoreactivity in Pomc-GFP and Pomc-Cre mice was performed by counting the percentage of cFOS- and pCREB-positive POMC–GFP or POMC-immunolabelled cells in 10-μm optical, confocal sections obtained from 50-μm-thick vibratome sections. For each mouse, at least 3–4 50-μm-thick sections containing the ARC were analysed.

Immunocytochemistry for electron microscopy

Male C57BL6 mice were anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with 4% PFA and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. After post-fixation overnight, vibratome sections (50 μm) containing the ARC were immunostained. After overnight incubation of primary antibodies (see Supplementary Table 1), sections were washed, incubated with biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (dilution 1:250, 711-065-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h, washed again, put in avidin–biotin complex (ABC; Vector Laboratories), and developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB). After washing, sections were incubated in 6 nm colloidal gold-conjugated donkey ant-sheep IgG secondary antibody (dilution 1:50, 713-195-147, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h. Sections were then osmicated (15 min in 1% osmium tetroxide) and dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations. During the dehydration, 1% uranyl acetate was added to the 70% ethanol to enhance ultrastructural membrane contrast. Flat embedding in Durcupan followed dehydration. Ultrathin sections were cut on a Leica ultra microtome, collected on Formvar-coated single-slot grids, and analysed with a Tecnai 12 Biotwin electron microscope (FEI).

Semi-quantitative measurements of α-MSH and β-endorphin immunostaining

Analyses of α-MSH and β-endorphin immunosignals in male mice were performed by use of ImageJ 1.48 s software, following the online tutorial for area measurements and particle counting (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/pdfs/examples.pdf). In brief, confocal stack images (z-stacks; thickness/optical section: 6 μm, resolution: 1,024 × 1,024 pixels) of one side of the PVN were obtained from 50-μm-thick vibratome brain sections, using the same magnification and the same confocal microscope setup for all samples. All images from the different experimental groups in one experiment were taken within the same session at the confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510 Meta). For z-projection, five optical sections from the middle area of each brain slice were used. Images were converted into greyscale (8 bit) and binary images were created. For particle analysis, the range of particle size (in pixel units) was set to resemble α-MSH and β-endorphin immunosignals in the PVN and to avoid selection of unspecific background staining. The same range of particle size was used for all samples. Finally, total numbers of selections (‘number’), the sum of the size of all selections (‘area’; in square pixels) and the sum of the average grey values of all selection (‘mean’ grey values) were calculated.

Electrophysiology

Coronal hypothalamic slices containing the ARC of male Pomc-gfp or NPY-hrGFP mice (3–4 weeks old) were prepared 90 min after in vivo saline or ACEA (1 mg kg−1 body weight) treatment, as described previously51. In brief, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated, the brain was rapidly removed and immersed in a cold (4 °C) and oxygenated cutting solution containing (mM): sucrose 220, KCl 2.5, NaH 2 PO 4 1.23, NaHCO 3 26, CaCl 2 1, MgCl 2 6 and glucose 10 (pH 7.3 with NaOH). Coronal hypothalamic slices (300 μm thick) were cut with a Leica vibratome after the brain was trimmed to a small tissue block containing the hypothalamus. After preparation, slices were maintained at room temperature (23–25 °C) in a storage chamber in the aCSF (bubbled with 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 ) containing (in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 3, CaCl 2 2, MgCl 2 2, NaH 2 PO 4 1.23, NaHCO 3 26, glucose 10 (pH 7.4 with NaOH) for recovery and storage. After recovery at room temperature for at least 1 h, slices were transferred to a recording chamber constantly perfused with bath solution (same as the aCSF except containing 2.5 mM glucose) at a temperature of 33 °C and a perfusion rate of 2 ml min−1 for electrophysiological experiments. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed in Pomc-GFP and Npy-hrGFP neurons under current clamp with the methods previously reported51. Spontaneous membrane and action potential was recorded for 10 min in Pomc-GFP and Npy-hrGFP neurons from both control and ACEA-treated mice.

To test the effects of ACEA on POMC neurons in vitro, hypothalamic slices containing the ARC were prepared from naive male Pomc-GFP mice. After a stable recording of membrane and action potential under current clamp or membrane current under voltage clamp (at −60 mV), ACEA was applied, in the presence or absence of TTX (0.5 μM), to the recorded cells through bath application for 10 min. The micropipettes (4–6 MΩ) were made of borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments) with a micropipette puller (Sutter P-97) and back filled with a pipette solution containing (mM): K-gluconate 135, MgCl 2 2, HEPES 10, EGTA 1.1, Mg-ATP 2.5, Na 2 -GTP 0.3, and Na 2 -phosphocreatin 10 (pH 7.3 with KOH). Both input resistance and series resistance were monitored throughout the experiments and the former was partially compensated. Only recordings with stable series resistance and input resistance were accepted. All data were sampled at 3–10 kHz, filtered at 3 kHz and analysed with an Apple Macintosh computer using AxoGraph X (Kagi).

Behavioural test (open field)

A slightly modified experimental regimen according ref. 52 was used. The apparatus consists of a Plexiglas open field (37 × 37 × 37 cm). Male C57BL6 mice habituated for single cage housing and intraperitoneal injection (see ‘food intake measurements’), were put in the open field for 90 min after injection with vehicle or ACEA (5 mg kg−1 body weight) and locomotor activity was monitored.

Central cannula placement

Anaesthetized (in mg kg−1body weight: intraperitoenal, 30 ketamine, 6 xylazine; subcutaneous; 0.1 buprenorphine) 10-week-old male C57BL6 or 12-week-old male Pomc-gfp mice were placed into a stereotaxic apparatus (model 902; David Kopf instruments). The head was cleaned with alcohol pads and incision was made with a sterile scalpel. To place the guide acute cannula (C315GA/SPC, 26 gauge, 8 mm pedestal size, 6.5 mm below pedestal; Plastics One), a single hole was drilled according to the following coordinates: ARC, bregma, anterior–posterior: −1.2 mm, lateral: +0.25 mm; PVN, bregma, anterior–posterior: −0.6 mm, lateral: +0.25 mm). The guided cannula was placed 1 mm dorsal to the region of interest to minimize damage of target area (ARC, bregma, dorsal–ventral: −5.0 mm, PVN, dorsal–ventral: −4.5 mm. The cannula was fixed in place with acrylic dental cement and one anchoring skull screw. After 30 min, a dummy cannula (C315DC/SPCA, cut length, 1 mm extension) was twisted onto the guided cannula. Mice were allowed to recover for 1 week, monitoring food intake and body weight. Mice with abnormal food intake or body weight were excluded. Mice were handled daily and habituated to the injection procedure for 5 days before experimental procedures. At the day of experiment, mice were held gently, while the dummy cannula was removed and the internal cannula (C315IA/SPC, 33 gauge, 8 mm pedestal size, cut length, 1 mm extension) was inserted. The internal cannula was connected to a plastic tube containing a Hamilton syringe at its end, allowing free movement of mice during injection. For PVN, NALO (5 μg per 0.5 μl saline, injection time 1 min) was injected 5 min before peripheral (intraperitoneal) injection of ACEA or WIN. For ARC, ACEA (1 μg per 0.5 μl saline (10% DMSO, 0.2% Tween-80); 1 min) was added. RIMO (1.25 μg per 0.5 μl saline (25% DMSO, 0.2% Tween-80); 1 min) was injected 5 min before peripheral (intraperitoneal) injection of ACEA or WIN. Internal cannula was kept in brain for another minute before replacement and, finally, dummy cannula was twisted onto guided cannulas and food intake was monitored for 1 and 2 h. In previous experiments equal volume injection of the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 (1:10 in saline) into the PVN or ARC was identified as an ideal spread of injection. After finishing food intake experiments, Hoechst 33342 was also used to assess correct cannula placement. Mice with missed target areas were excluded.

Stereotaxic virus injection

Animals were injected as described earlier3,53. In brief, bilateral virus injections were made into the ARC of anaesthetized (see ‘central cannula placement’) 12-week-old male Pomc-Cre mice, placed into a stereotaxic apparatus (model 902; David Kopf instruments). Viruses (200 nl) containing the inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5/EF1α-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry) or the stimulating DREADD (rAAV5/EF1α-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry) were applied into each hemisphere (coordinates: bregma, anterior–posterior: −1.2 mm, dorsal–ventral: −5.8 mm, lateral: ±0.3 mm) by using an air pressure system (injection time 5 min). After surgery, mice were allowed to recover for 1 week and were then acclimated for food intake experiments (see ‘food intake measurements’). After finishing the feeding experiments, mice were transcardially perfused and 50-μm-thick vibratome sections of the ARC were prepared. Accurate virus injection into the ARC was verified by analysing local mCherry fluorescence. Mice with ‘missed’ or ‘partial’ hits were excluded. Specific (virus) expression in ARC POMC neurons was signified by double fluorescence labelling for mCherry and POMC (see ‘immunofluorescence’).

Food intake measurements

One week before starting experiments, animals were allowed to habituate to single cage housing. Sham injections were performed 2 days before starting the experiment. The day before experiment, single home cages were changed to avoid mice eating food that may have been deposited in the bedding of the cages. To generally minimize disposal of food, the animals were adapted to lower amounts of food (15–25 g per cage) at starting adaption to single housing. To analyse the effect of the CB 1 R agonist ACEA or the CBR agonist WIN on food intake in fed animals, food was removed, new pre-weighed food pellets were applied and food intake of each single-housed animal was measured 1, 2 and 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of ACEA or WIN, compared to vehicle, respectively (injection time: 09:00). In the DREADD feeding experiments, CNO (0.3 mg kg−1 body weight; intraperitoneal) was injected 15 min before cannabinoid (ACEA or WIN) treatment. To investigate whether cannabinoid (ACEA or WIN)-induced feeding is mediated via β-endorphin release, the μ-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (7.5 mg kg−1 body weight; intraperitoneal) was injected 15 min before cannabinoid (ACEA or WIN) administration and food intake was analysed 1 h after injection. To address the question whether CB 1 R inverse agonist RIMO reduced fasting-induced re-feeding, the single-housed animals were fasted overnight before intraperitoneal injection of 3 mg kg−1 RIMO or vehicle (injection time: 09:00). Fifteen minutes after RIMO injection, a pre-weighed amount of food was placed into the cage and the food intake was then calculated for 1, 2 and 24 h. At all times the cages were inspected for food spillage and those mice in cages with visible food deposits in the bedding were excluded from the studies.

Radioimmunoassay

Male C57BL6 mice were killed by decapitation and brains were immediately removed. A block of the hypothalamus was cut and a 2-mm slice of the mediobasal forebrain was made using a Leica VT1000P vibratome. Each slice was first incubated with aCSF in an incubator (37 °C, 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ) for 1 h. This was followed by another incubation in aCSF, followed by incubation in aCSF (control) or in aCSF containing 100 nM ACEA (both groups containing 56 mM KCl) for 45 min. The supernatant was then removed and frozen for future RIA analysis. The α-MSH and β-endorphin radioimmunoassays were performed following instructions of the Phoenix pharmaceutical RIA kit (α-MSH, RK-043-01; β-endorphin, RK-022-33).

ELISA

Ex vivo measurements of β-endorphin content in mediobasal hypothalamus derived from male wild-type and corresponding Cnr1−/− littermates was assessed by use of a commercially available β-endorphin ELISA kit and in accordance to manufacturer’s instructions (MyBioSource, MBS703919). In brief, 30 mg of tissue was rinsed and mechanically homogenized in PBS. After two freeze–thaw cycles, the homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000g and 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and assayed immediately. In parallel, sample protein concentrations were measured using the BCA kit (Thermo scientific, 23228 and 1859078), and β-endorphin content was calculated as nanograms β-endorphin per milligram protein.

qPCR and western blot analyses

Food was removed from cages of fed mice. Male C57BL6 mice were then treated with vehicle or ACEA (1 mg kg−1 body weight, intraperitoneal) as described above. After 90 min, the mediobasal hypothalamus was rapidly collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized by First-Strand cDNA Kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR (Light Cycler 480 System, Roche) was performed using TaqMan gene expression assay for Psck1, Pcsk2, Ucp2 and Cnr1 (Mm00479023_m1, 4331182; Mm00500981_m1, 4331182; Mm00627599_m1, 4331182; Mm01212171_s1, 4331182; Life Technologies). β-actin (mouse Actb, 4352341; Life Technologies) was used as housekeeping gene.

Micro-punched ARC from fed male C57BL6 mice, either treated with vehicle or ACEA (1 mg kg−1 body weight, intraperitoneal) for 90 min after removal of food, were isolated and lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11 836 170 001), on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for 15 min. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA kit (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were resolved on 8% SDS–PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, IPVH 15150). Membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl) for 1 h and then followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with first antibodies (see Supplementary Table 1). After three washes with TBST (TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2004) for 1 h and developed by ECL kit (Thermo Scientific, 32016). Membranes were reused to detect β-actin (see Supplementary Table 1) after stripping with Restore PLUS Western Blot stripping buffer (46430, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The relative protein amount of PC-1, PC-2 and POMC in each sample was calculated from the respective β-actin immunosignal.

ROS measurement

After removal of food at 10:00, fed age- and weight-matched littermates of male and female Pomc-GFP mice were injected with vehicle or 1 mg kg−1 ACEA (intraperitoneal) for 90 min. DHE (10 mg) was dissolved in 200 μl DMSO 5 min before injection and kept light-protected at room temperature. Then 240 μl of warm (42 °C) PBS was slowly mixed with 60 μl DHE solution, and 200 μl of the DHE solution (1 mg ml−1 in 20% DMSO) was injected via the tail vein 45 min before the animals were anaesthetized by isofluorane and killed by perfusion fixation (4% PFA in 0.1 M PBS). After post-fixation in 4% PFA overnight, the brains were washed in PBS for 30 min and coronal brain sections (50 μm) of the ARC were obtained using a Leica VT1000P vibratome (Leica Microsystems). The slices were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped using DAKO fluorescence mounting medium (Dako North America) and kept at 4 °C for no longer than 1 day. Confocal images were taken by use of an Olympus FV 300 Laserscanning microscope. Semi-quantitative analysis of the DHE signal in Pomc-GFP labelled cells was performed by determine the mean dens area of the DHE signal in the respective GFP positive neuron, using imagej 1.48 s software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, US National Institutes of Health). To avoid false-positive results, the autofluorescence in animals that were injected with saline instead of DHE was subtracted from the DHE-obtained values.

Brain tissue fractionation

Mouse brain homogenates were purified using a differential centrifugation method described earlier54. After removal of food from cages, mice were injected with vehicle or ACEA for 90 min. For isolation of mitochondria-enriched fractions, male and female C57BL6, Ucp2−/−and corresponding wild-type littermates were killed and both the hippocampus and the hypothalamus were immediately dissected from brains and put on ice. Tissue was manually homogenized at 4 °C in 10 ml of isolation buffer containing 225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mg ml−1 BSA and 0.3125 mg ml−1 protease type VIII (Sigma-Aldrich) at pH 7.4. The homogenate was brought to 20 ml final volume and centrifuged at 2,000g for 5 min. The pellet, including the synaptosomal layer was re-suspended in 10 ml of the isolation buffer now containing 0.02% (w/v) digitonin and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min. The pellet without the synaptosomal layer was re-suspended in 10 ml of isolation buffer and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min. The pellet was finally re-suspended in 50 μl of a buffer containing 225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES at pH 7.4.

Ex vivo mitochondrial respiration

Protein concentrations of mitochondrial preparations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Perbio). For mitochondrial respiration analyses, 0.5 mg ml−1 protein was added into the reaction chamber of a Clark type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments) which has been set to 37 °C and filled with 1 ml respiration buffer (100 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 10 μM EGTA, pH 7.4). Pyruvate (5 mM) and malate (2.5 mM) were then added concomitantly as the oxidative substrates. To determine ADP-dependent (state 3) respiration, ADP (2.5 mM) was added. After the ADP was exhausted, oligomycin (1 μM) was applied to analyse respiration independently of phosphorylation (state 4 activity).

Statistics

Statistical analyses were performed by use of Prism 6.0 software (Graph Pad). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. P values for unpaired comparisons between two groups were calculated by two-tailed Student’s t-test. One-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test (all groups against vehicle-treated control group) was used for comparisons between three or more groups. Ordinary two-way ANOVA, followed by Šidák’s multiple comparison test was used to examine how food intake was affected by two factors. Interactions between the following treatments were tested: CNO against ACEA or WIN; RIMO against ACEA or WIN; NALO against ACEA or WIN; ACEA treatment against genotype (wild-type littermates versus Ucp2−/−mice). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Error bars indicate mean ± s.e.m. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.

Answer: The context provided does not directly address how cannabis affects our desire for food. However, it does mention the use of CB1 receptor agonists like ACEA and WIN, which are related to the cannabinoid system, in experiments involving mice. These compounds were used to study their effects on food intake, suggesting that the cannabinoid system, which is influenced by cannabis, may play a role in regulating feeding behavior. Specifically, the experiments involved measuring food intake after administering these compounds, indicating a potential link between cannabinoid receptor activation and increased food consumption.

Answer: To discover all genes and their functions, researchers typically use a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Here are some common methods:

1. **Gene Sequencing**: Techniques like whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) are used to identify genes and their expression levels in different tissues or conditions.

2. **Gene Expression Analysis**: Real-time PCR and microarrays can be used to measure the expression levels of genes under various conditions, helping to infer their functions.

3. **Gene Knockout/Knockdown Studies**: Techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 or RNA interference (RNAi) are used to disrupt the function of specific genes to study the resulting phenotypic changes.

4. **Bioinformatics Tools**: Computational methods, including gene regulatory network inference and functional annotation databases, help predict gene functions based on sequence similarity, expression patterns, and known interactions.

5. **Protein Interaction Studies**: Techniques like yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation are used to identify protein interactions, which can provide insights into gene function.

6. **Comparative Genomics**: By comparing the genomes of different species, researchers can identify conserved genes and infer their functions based on evolutionary conservation.

7. **Functional Genomics Databases**: Resources like the Gene Ontology (GO) database provide curated information on gene functions, biological processes, and cellular components.

These methods, often used in combination, allow researchers to systematically discover genes and elucidate their functions in various biological contexts.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================

You’ve probably seen them before—those pesky codling moths that seem to invade your fruit tree every year. Well, this year you can get rid of them naturally without resorting to synthetic pesticides.

There are a lot of different methods you can try, but we’ll be focusing on 17 of them. Keep reading for more information on how to control codling moths using natural remedies.

Identification

Codling moths can be a major problem for apple and pear growers . These pests lay eggs on the fruit, and when the larvae hatch, they burrow into the fruit, making it unmarketable.

The adult moths are easy to identify. They have a grayish-brown body with a wingspan of about 12 to 20 mm. The larvae are small and white (or light pink) with dark brown heads.

Codling moth eggs look like tiny, translucent pancakes, and they can be difficult to spot. You’ll find them on leaves and fruits.

How to Get Rid of Codling Moths Naturally

If you think you have a codling moth infestation, there are several natural ways to deal with the issue.

One is to place a band around apple trees or other affected plants to help capture and kill adult moths and moth worms. You can also pick off the infested fruits by hand.

Below is a comprehensive list of the different DIY remedies and organic solutions.

1. Beneficial Nematodes

You may have heard of beneficial nematodes—tiny, soil-dwelling creatures that are effective at controlling certain garden pests. Here’s a little more information about how they work:

Beneficial nematodes enter the larvae of the codling moth and kill them. As the nematodes feed on the larvae, they release bacteria that are fatal to the pests.

Best of all, these tiny creatures are non-toxic to plants, people, and pets, and they are 100% organic. If you’re looking for an environmentally-friendly way to deal with the problem, beneficial nematodes may be the answer for you.

Moreover, you can easily acquire them online or at certain garden centers.

2. Moth Traps

There are many types of moth traps available, like this one and this one. These work by releasing a scent that attracts male moths. However, the most commonly used are those that use pheromones to attract the moths.

Pheromones are chemicals that mimic the scent of the female moth, which the male moth uses to find her. When the male moth detects the pheromone, he flies towards it and ends up getting trapped in the trap.

Use these traps to lure the moths in and kill them. Once they’re drawn in, they can’t escape, and eventually they die.

Alternatively, make some homemade codling moth traps. These traps can be used to catch male and female moths.

Fill up a gallon plastic milk jug by adding two cups of apple cider vinegar and half a cup of molasses. Add water to fill up the rest of the jug.

Cut a hole in the jug so you can hang it up in a tree. Make more than one of these, as you’ll need about three traps per tree.

3. Spinosad

This organic pesticide is made from the fermentation of naturally occurring soil bacteria. It is effective at killing codling moths and other pests. It’s also non-toxic to people and pets, making it a safer option than many chemical pesticides.

You can use Spinosad in a number of ways, including as a spray, dust, or pour-on. It’s important to follow the instructions on the label for the best results.

4. Kaolin Clay

This is a soft, white clay that can be used directly on the trees to create a barrier that repels codling moths.

Kaolin clay is also effective at repelling other pests, like thrips and Colorado potato beetles, so it’s a great choice if you’re having problems with more than one type of insect.

This is our recommended brand.

5. Birds

Birds are another effective organic codling moth control method you can make use of.

Attract birds to your garden or orchard by putting up a bird feeder and filling it with a mix of seeds and nuts.

The birds will fly in to eat the treats. They will also eat the moths and their eggs, helping to reduce the population in your yard and garden.

6. Trichogramma Wasps

These tiny parasitic wasps lay their eggs inside the eggs of codling moths, which then kill the caterpillars before they can hatch.

You can buy these tiny parasites. Or, you can attract them with plants such as catnip, sage, and peppermint .

7. Pick Up and Discard Fallen Fruits

One of the simplest things you can do to help prevent codling moths from taking over is to pick up and discard any fallen fruits.

This will help keep the pests from multiplying. It will also make the area around your fruit trees less attractive to them.

8. Cardboard



One of the easiest ways to trap codling moths is to use cardboard. All you need to do is cut a broad strip of cardboard that is long enough to wrap around the tree.

This will provide an attractive nesting spot for the moth worms to spin their cocoons.

9. Neem Oil

Neem oil has a number of excellent properties, including being an effective insecticide, fungicide, and repellent.

You can buy the concentrate and apply it following the instructions, or you can buy the pure oil and make a DIY codling moth spray.

To use neem oil for codling moths, simply combine one tablespoon of the oil, one teaspoon of liquid soap, and a gallon of water.

Shake well, apply it to the affected areas using a spray bottle, and let it soak in.

It is effective against the moths and will also smother and kill the eggs. You should start to see a difference within a few days.

10. Fruit Bagging

Another simple but time-consuming home remedy to control codling moths organically is to bag each fruit. When the fruit is still green on the tree, put a bag over it.

However, make sure to check the bag often to see the development of the fruit once harvest nears. Once the fruit is ripe, you can pick it, wash it, and enjoy it as you like.

11. Pick Off Larvae and Cocoons

One of the first steps to tackling the problem is to pick off codling moth larvae and cocoons from the tree as soon as you see them.

Scrape off cocoons from tree bark and dispose of them in a sealed bag, or just squish them. Also, pick off larvae-infested fruits and dispose of them.

12. Clean-Up Orchard

It’s important to clean up your orchard after the codling moth infestation has been dealt with. This will help to get rid of any eggs that may have been left behind.

Removing infested fruits will also help prevent future infestations.

13. Azera Gardening

Azera Gardening is an organic insecticide. The product that contains pyrethrins and azadirachtin is a great choice for dealing with these pests.

It’s also safe to use on fruit trees and other plants. Plus, it’s non-toxic, so it won’t harm the environment or your family or pets.

14. Bacillus thuringiensis v. kurstaki (Btk)

You can also use Bacillus thuringiensis v. kurstaki (Btk) to control the critters. This bacterium is deadly to caterpillar pests.

You can buy Btk in powder or liquid form, and it’s easy to use. Just apply it according to the instructions in areas where you’ve seen these pests.

It will kill codling moth caterpillars that come into contact with it.

15. Arber Bio Insecticide

The Arber Bio Insecticide is made with an active ingredient that poisons these pests. Moreover, you can use it on vegetables, fruit trees, tropical plants, and more.

It works on both soil-dwelling and foliage-feeding pests.

16. Repellent Plants

There are also a few plants that act as natural deterrents to codling moths, including tansy, nasturtiums, and lavender. Planting these will help minimize codling moth problems.

Takeaway

As you can see, there are a few different ways to protect your plants from codling moth damage. You can use traps, natural predators, or sprays.

No matter which method you choose, stay vigilant and check your trees for signs of infestation.

Almost everyone has bitten into a "wormy" apple or pear, an unpleasant experience. A "worm" in homegrown fruit is not really a worm, but most likely a codling moth caterpillar. Called "one of the most damaging insects of apples and pears,"1 it can be a problem in commercial orchards as well as for backyard fruit trees.

Alternative techniques for dealing with codling moth have been widely accepted by farmers, and have reduced orchard pesticide use by 80 percent according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.2 Successful non-chemical techniques are also available for home gardeners. For best results, use a combination of techniques.

9 Natural Ways to Manage Codling Moths

1. Choosing Resistant Varieties

If you're planting new trees, choose varieties that will minimize future codling moth problems. Early maturing apples like Jonagolds, Gravensteins, Galas, Macintoshes, and Red Delicious, are less susceptible to codling moth than late-maturing varieties.3 Planting trees with semi-dwarf rootstocks is helpful. The smaller trees will make it easier for you to manage codling moths.3

2. Thinning Your Apple Crop

Thinning apples so that your tree has only one apple per fruit cluster is generally recommended in order to keep your tree vigorous (it also allows your tree to produce a good crop every year). Thin apples when fruit are small (the size of a marble or walnut). When you thin your crop, be sure to remove any fruit that have small holes made by codling moth caterpillars. Bury these apples, or put them in a black plastic bag in the sun for a month. Composting doesn't destroy all the caterpillars.3

3. Picking Up Dropped Apples

Collect any dropped fruit weekly because caterpillars leave dropped fruit quickly. Dispose of them the same way as thinned apples.3

4. Trapping Moths

There are three ways to trap codling moths: pheromone traps, black light traps, and homemade traps. Pheromones are attractants produced by female moths to attract males. Pheromone traps release this attractant chemical and also have a sticky surface for trapping moths. They catch only males. Such traps have "shown mixed results" according to the University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. They are most effective when your trees are at least a mile from other trees being used by codling moths (apples, pears, and walnuts). To use pheromone traps, start in early spring. Hang the traps in trees twenty to fifty feet away from your fruit trees. Hang one to four traps per tree (depending on the size of the tree) about six feet off the ground.4

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's national sustainable agricultural information center recommends black light traps. These can be purchased, and attract both male and female moths.5 You can also use homemade traps that catch both male and female moths. Fill a plastic gallon milk jug with 1 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup molasses, 1/8 teaspoon ammonia, and 5 cups of water. Cut a 2 inch hole in the jug, just below its shoulder. Hang up to 3 traps per tree, depending on the size of the tree.4

5. Trapping Caterpillars

You can make simple traps for caterpillars from ordinary corrugated cardboard. Use a four-inch-wide strip and wrap it snugly around the tree trunk. The corrugation should be vertical (up and down the trunk). You can use staples to attach the cardboard to the trunk; it should be at least a foot and a half above the ground. Caterpillars will crawl under the cardboard and use the "tunnels" as protected spots to spin their cocoons. Once they have spun their cocoons, remove the cardboard and destroy it.4 The trick to using this method is timing it properly. You can catch the overwintering generation of caterpillars by putting up bands in August and destroying them between November and January.4 For other generations, watch the traps and destroy and replace them when you see cocoons.6

6. Bagging

In the early 1990s, two California extension agents tested a novel pesticide-free technique for protecting apples from codling moth. The technique uses paper lunch bags to protect developing apples. Use the bags by cutting a two inch slit in the bottom of the bags. Put this opening over fruit when the fruit is between one and two inches in diameter and staple the open end of the bag closed around the fruit. Then leave the bags on the tree until harvest. The bags also protect the fruit from sunburn. Although the technique is time consuming, "for individuals with few trees, bagging can result in quality fruit without significant loss due to codling moth."7

The Home Orchard Society has hands-on advice about bagging apples with paper bags and even nylon footies.8,9

7. Biological Control: Trichogramma Wasps

Trichogramma wasps are minute wasps that lay their eggs in moth eggs, including the eggs of the codling moth. When the wasp eggs hatch, the juvenile wasp eats the moth egg. Trichogramma wasps are available commercially. If you want to try using these wasps, release two or three batches one week apart when the moths start to lay eggs3 (approximately mid-April in the Northwest1). The wasps are usually sold as pupae on little cards which you put in small cups hung in the tree. The wasps feed on nectar and pollen so will do best if there are flowers nearby.3

8. Natural Predators: Birds

Woodpeckers have been observed eating significant numbers of codling moth caterpillars. These birds feed on the caterpillars after they leave the fruit at the end of the summer and during the fall when the larvae are in cocoons on the trunk of the tree. Other important codling moth predators are nuthatches and creepers.10

9. Biological Control: Codling Moth Virus

The codling moth granulovirus offers "potential for effective and selective control"11 of codling moth and "has been considered the most effective biological control agent ever tested against the codling moth."10 The virus is available commercially and should be applied weekly for best results.10 According to their manufacturers, "inert" ingredients in commercial codling moth granulovirus products include glycerin, water, and insect parts associated with growing the virus.12,13

Identification & Life Cycle of Codling Moths

Identifying Codling Moths

The codling moth is a gray moth about 3/4 inch across. Usually its wings are marked with copper lines and a gold or bronze spot. Mature caterpillars are white with a brown head and about 3/4 inch long.1

Life Cycle

In order to successfully manage codling moths, you'll need to understand the life cycle of this insect. It spends the winter as a caterpillar in a cocoon, usually under loose bark on a tree trunk or in some other protected spot. Adults emerge from the cocoon in April or May. The females lay eggs on leaves and small fruit for about a month. When the eggs hatch, the young caterpillars feed on the surface of the fruit for a few days, then burrow into the center. They feed about three weeks, then tunnel out of the fruit and find a place to spin a cocoon. In the Northwest, there can be between one and three generations per year.1

Answer: An organic farmer dealing with a codling moth infestation has several natural pest control options to consider. Here are some methods and how to implement them:

1. **Beneficial Nematodes**: These are tiny, soil-dwelling creatures that can be applied to the soil around the trees. They enter the larvae of the codling moth and kill them. The farmer can purchase these nematodes online or at garden centers and apply them according to the instructions.

2. **Moth Traps**: Use pheromone traps to attract and capture male moths. These traps should be hung in the trees early in the season, with one to four traps per tree depending on the size. Homemade traps using a mixture of apple cider vinegar and molasses can also be used.

3. **Spinosad**: This organic pesticide can be applied as a spray, dust, or pour-on. The farmer should follow the label instructions for application.

4. **Kaolin Clay**: Apply this clay directly to the trees to create a barrier that repels codling moths. It can also help with other pests.

5. **Birds**: Attract birds to the orchard by setting up bird feeders. Birds will help control the moth population by eating the moths and their eggs.

6. **Trichogramma Wasps**: Release these parasitic wasps, which lay their eggs inside codling moth eggs, killing them. The farmer can purchase these wasps and release them in the orchard.

7. **Pick Up and Discard Fallen Fruits**: Regularly collect and dispose of any fallen fruits to prevent the larvae from leaving the fruit and continuing their life cycle.

8. **Cardboard Traps**: Wrap corrugated cardboard around the tree trunks to trap caterpillars. Remove and destroy the cardboard once the caterpillars have spun their cocoons.

9. **Neem Oil**: Apply a mixture of neem oil, liquid soap, and water to the affected areas using a spray bottle. This will smother and kill the eggs and larvae.

10. **Fruit Bagging**: Bag individual fruits with paper bags or nylon footies to protect them from moths. This method is time-consuming but effective for small orchards.

11. **Biological Control with Codling Moth Virus**: Apply the codling moth granulovirus, which is effective against the moths. It should be applied weekly for best results.

The best approach is to use a combination of these methods for effective control. The farmer should start early in the season and remain vigilant, regularly checking the trees for signs of infestation.

Answer: An organic farmer dealing with a codling moth infestation has several natural pest control options. Here are some methods and how to implement them effectively:

1. **Beneficial Nematodes**: These are tiny, soil-dwelling creatures that enter and kill codling moth larvae. They are non-toxic and 100% organic. The farmer can purchase them online or at garden centers and apply them to the soil around the affected trees.

2. **Moth Traps**: Use pheromone traps to attract and trap male moths. These traps should be hung in trees early in the spring, about six feet off the ground, and spaced appropriately depending on the tree size. Homemade traps using apple cider vinegar and molasses can also be effective.

3. **Spinosad**: This organic pesticide, derived from soil bacteria, can be used as a spray or dust. It is non-toxic to humans and pets. The farmer should follow the label instructions for application.

4. **Kaolin Clay**: Apply this soft, white clay directly to trees to create a barrier that repels codling moths and other pests. It is a good option if the farmer is dealing with multiple pest issues.

5. **Birds**: Attract natural predators like woodpeckers and nuthatches by setting up bird feeders. These birds will help control the moth population by eating the caterpillars and eggs.

6. **Trichogramma Wasps**: These parasitic wasps lay eggs inside codling moth eggs, preventing them from hatching. The farmer can purchase these wasps and release them in the orchard when moths start laying eggs.

7. **Fruit Bagging**: Bagging individual fruits with paper bags or nylon footies can protect them from moths. This method is time-consuming but effective for small orchards.

8. **Codling Moth Virus**: This biological control agent can be applied weekly to target codling moths specifically. It is available commercially and should be used according to the manufacturer's instructions.

9. **Repellent Plants**: Planting tansy, nasturtiums, and lavender around the orchard can help deter codling moths naturally.

For best results, the farmer should use a combination of these methods, monitor the orchard regularly for signs of infestation, and adjust strategies as needed.

Ask the Physicist! your intuition is getting in the way of your understanding the HUP because you are trying to apply it to a macroscopic object and it is completely unnoticeable in that regime. To understand this, we have to get a little more quantitative. The HUP states that the product of the uncertainties in the momentum and position must be on the order of Planck's constant or greater. Now, Planck's constant is on the order of 10-34 kg m2/s2. So if your uncertainty in measuring momentum to be zero is 1/1,000,000 kg m/s, then you can measure its position to an accuracy

Answer: If Planck's constant were on the order of 1 meter, it would have profound implications for the physical world. Planck's constant is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics that determines the scale at which quantum effects become significant. Currently, it is extremely small (on the order of 10^-34 kg m^2/s^2), which is why quantum effects are typically only noticeable at microscopic scales, such as with electrons and atoms.

If Planck's constant were much larger, on the order of 1 meter, quantum effects would become significant at macroscopic scales. This means that everyday objects, like those humans interact with regularly, would exhibit quantum behavior. The uncertainty principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in momentum and position must be on the order of Planck's constant or greater, would apply to macroscopic objects. As a result, it would be impossible to precisely measure both the position and momentum of large objects, leading to a world where classical mechanics would no longer be sufficient to describe the motion of macroscopic objects. The deterministic nature of classical physics would be replaced by the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, fundamentally altering our understanding and interaction with the physical world.

Answer: The context provided does not directly address the hypothetical scenario of Planck's constant being on the order of 1 meter. However, I can provide a general explanation based on physics principles.

If Planck's constant were on the order of 1 meter, it would fundamentally alter the scale at which quantum effects become significant. Currently, Planck's constant is extremely small (approximately \(6.626 \times 10^{-34}\) m² kg / s), which means quantum effects are typically only noticeable at very small scales, such as those of atoms and subatomic particles.

If Planck's constant were much larger, quantum effects would become apparent at macroscopic scales. This would mean that everyday objects could exhibit behaviors like superposition and entanglement, which are currently only observed at the quantum level. The classical world as we know it would be drastically different, with quantum mechanics playing a dominant role in the behavior of macroscopic objects.

2. **Anxiety or Stress**: Dogs may hump as a way to cope with anxiety or stress. It can be a self-soothing behavior.

3. **Medical Conditions**: Although less common, underlying medical conditions could contribute to this behavior. It's important to rule out any potential health issues with a veterinarian.

4. **Attention-Seeking**: If the dog receives attention (positive or negative) when it humps, it may continue the behavior to get more attention.

5. **Lack of Stimulation**: Dogs that are not mentally or physically stimulated enough may resort to humping as a way to entertain themselves.

Key Facts & Information

EARLY ASSYRIAN PERIOD

The history of Assyria is divided into four periods: (1) Old Assyrian Empire, (2) Early Assyrian Period, (3) Middle Assyrian Period, and (4) New Assyrian Period.

During this period, Assur was the main settlement of Assyria.

Assur was a city-state.

The earliest known ruler during this period was Tudiya.

Tudiya was succeeded by Adamu.

According to the Assyrian King List, there were thirteen other rulers after Adamu. They were Yangi, Suhlamu, Harharu, Mandaru, Imsu, Harsu, Didanu, Hana, Zuabu, Nuabu, Abazu, Belu, and Azarah.

During this period, Assyria became subject to the Akkadian Empire, which was ruled by Sargon the Great.

Due to economic decline, internal civil war, and attacks from the barbarian Gutian people, the Akkadian Empire was destroyed.

OLD ASSYRIAN EMPIRE

The second period in the history of Assyria is the Old Assyrian Empire.

During this period, Assyria was able to establish colonies in Anatolia and the Levant.

As a whole, the land of Assyria during this period consisted of a number of city-states and small Semitic-speaking kingdoms.

During this period, Assyrian kings established relationships, either as rivals, neighbors, or trading partners, with the Hattians and Hurrians to the north of Anatolia; the Gutian people, the Lullubi, and the Turukkaeans to the east; the Amorites to the west; and other Sumero-Akkadian city-states, including Isin, Kish, Ur, Eshnunna, and Larsa.

Settlements during this period included Assur, Shubat-Enlil, Nineveh, Karum, Karum Kanesh, Ankuwa, and Hattusa.

Ashur, head of the Assyrian pantheon, was a deity worshipped mainly in Upper Mesopotamia, including the Old Assyrian Empire.

MIDDLE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE

The third period in the history of Assyria is the period which lies between the fall of the Old Assyrian Empire and the establishment of the New Assyrian Period (also known as the Neo-Assyrian Empire). It is known as the Middle Assyrian Empire.

During this period, the Assyrian Empire saw the reigns of many great kings, including Ashur-uballit I, Arik-den-ili, Tukulti-Ninurta I, and Tiglath-Pileser I.

During this period, Assyria was able to overthrow the

Hurri-Mitanni Empire.

Hurri-Mitanni Empire. The Hittites failed to save Mitanni. They later joined forces with the Babylonians to wage an economic war against Assyria, but this resulted in failure.

During this period, Assyria was organized and under the firm control of their king, who also functioned as the High Priest of Ashur, the state god.

Priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society.

During this period, Assyria became known as a warrior society due to the long wars that happened.

Assyrian free males were obliged to serve in the army for a time. This system was called the ilku-service.

Due to the Bronze Age Collapse, the Dark Age for the entire Near East, North Africa, Asia Minor, Caucasus, the Mediterranean, and the Balkan regions happened.

The collapse did not affect the Assyrian Empire much, but the death of Ashur-bel-kala resulted in a comparative decline of the empire.

Despite the visible weakness of the empire, as compared to its previous strength, the Assyrian Empire was still an empire with a stable monarchy, a powerful army, and secured borders. Due to these, the empire had leverage over its potential rivals, such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia, Lydia, and Media.

NEO-ASSYRIAN EMPIRE

The ascension of Adad-nirari II marked the start of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

During this period, Assyria was able to maintain a large and thriving rural population.

The major Assyrian cities during this time included Nineveh, Assur, Kalhu (Calah, Nimrud), Arbela (Erbil), Arrapha (Karka, Kirkuk), Dur-Sharrukin, Imgur-Enlil, Carchemish, Harran, Tushhan, Til-Barsip, Ekallatum, Kanesh, Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta, Urhai (Edessa), Guzana, Kahat, Amid (Diyarbakir), Mérida (Mardin, Tabitu, Nuhadra (Dohuk), Ivah, Sepharvaim, Rachae, Purushanda, Sabata, Birtha (Tikrit), Tell Shemshara, Dur-Katlimmu and Shekhna.

With the rise of Adad-nirari II, Assyria expanded its empire in all directions into Anatolia, Ancient Iran, Levant, and Babylonia.

Ashurbanipal II continued this expansion and later moved the capital from Ashur to Kalhu.

Assyria experienced a period of instability and decline after the reign of Adad-nirari III until the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III.

Tiglath-Pileser III created the world’s first professional army, and he was able to conquer areas as far as the East Mediterranean.

In history, Assyria was able to conquer Babylonia, Chaldea, Elam, Media, Persia, Urartu (Armenia), Phoenicia, Aramea/Syria, Phrygia, the Neo-Hittite States, the Hurrian lands, Arabia, Gutium, Israel, Judah, Samarra, Moab, Edom, Corduene, Cilicia, Mannea, and Cyprus.

DOWNFALL

After the death of Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian Empire experienced its worst decline.

The empire experienced brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, Ashur-etil-ilani, Sin-shumu-lishir, and Sin-shar-ishkun.

Due to the civil wars, several other groups took advantage of the situation and raided Assyrian areas.

POST-ASSYRIAN EMPIRE

After its fall, Assyria came under the rule of the short-lived Median Empire.

Soon after, Assyria was ruled by the Persian Achaemenid Empire.

During this time, Assyria got back on its feet and became a major agricultural and administrative center of the empire.

After some time, Assyria fell to Alexander the Great, the Macedonian Emperor.

By 150 BC, Assyria fell under the control of the Parthian Empire.

During this period, Christianity arrived in Assyria.

During the Christian period, Assyria fell under control of the Sasanian Empire and was invaded by the Mongols.

Assyrians then suffered a number of religiously and ethnically introduced massacres, including the Simele Massacre and World War II.

The Assyrian Empire started off as a major regional power in Mesopotamia in the second millennium B.C.E., but later grew in size and stature in the first millennium B.C.E. under a series of powerful rulers, becoming one of the world’s earliest empires .

Assyria was located in the northern part of Mesopotamia, which corresponds to most parts of modern-day Iraq as well as parts of Iran, Kuwait, Syria, and Turkey. It had relatively humble beginnings as a nation-state early in the second millennium B.C.E. Its status underwent many changes; though sometimes it was an independent state, it also fell to the Babylonian Empire, and later to Mittani rule. But unlike other nation-states, because of their technological advances in warfare, the Assyrians maintained their land while other states and empires rose and fell from power. When another group, the Hittites, rose to power and overthrew Mittani rule, it left a power vacuum that sent the region into war and chaos. This left the Assyrians poised to gain more power in the region. Around 900 B.C.E., a new series of Assyrian kings, beginning with Adad Nirari II, rose to prominence and expanded Assyria’s borders into a huge empire.

Adad Nirari II and his successors used new warfare techniques to take over enemy cities one by one. The Assyrians had several advantages that they had been developing for generations while other empires came and went. They were the first in the area to develop iron weapons, which were superior to the bronze weapons their enemies were using. Their skill at ironworking allowed them to make weapons and protective items more cheaply, so more soldiers could use them. In addition, they were the first army to have a separate engineering unit, which would set up ladders and ramps, fill in moats, and dig tunnels to help the soldiers get into a walled city. They were also among the first to build chariots, which provided greater protection on the battlefield. These technological advancements allowed the Assyrians to go on the offensive and attack neighboring areas for the first time, which led to the expansion of their empire .

The Assyrian Empire maintained power for hundreds of years. But in the 600s B.C.E., the empire became too large to maintain, and it fell apart. Even after its fall, the empire’s legacy lived on in the warfare tactics and technologies that were adopted by later civilizations.
Answer: The internal civil problems of the Assyrian Empire included a series of brutal civil wars involving rival kings, such as Ashur-etil-ilani, Sin-shumu-lishir, and Sin-shar-ishkun. These internal conflicts weakened the empire, making it vulnerable to external attacks and raids by other groups. The civil wars contributed significantly to the decline and eventual downfall of the Assyrian Empire.

It had relatively humble beginnings as a nation-state early in the second millennium B.C.E. Its status underwent many changes; though sometimes it was an independent state, it also fell to the Babylonian Empire, and later to Mittani rule. But unlike other nation-states, because of their technological advances in warfare, the Assyrians maintained their land while other states and empires rose and fell from power. When another group, the Hittites, rose to power and overthrew Mittani rule, it left a power vacuum that sent the region into war and chaos. This left the Assyrians poised to gain more power in the region. Around 900 B.C.E., a new series of Assyrian kings, beginning with Adad Nirari II, rose to prominence and expanded Assyria’s borders into a huge empire.\\n\\nAdad Nirari II and his successors used new warfare techniques to take over enemy cities one by one. The Assyrians had several advantages that they had been developing for generations while other empires came and went. They were the first in the area to develop iron weapons, which were superior to the bronze weapons their enemies were using. Their skill at ironworking allowed them to make weapons and protective items more cheaply, so more soldiers could use them. In addition, they were the first army to have a separate engineering unit, which would set up ladders and ramps, fill in moats, and dig tunnels to help the soldiers get into a walled city. They were also among the first to build chariots, which provided greater protection on the battlefield. These technological advancements allowed the Assyrians to go on the offensive and attack neighboring areas for the first time, which led to the expansion of their empire .\\n\\nThe Assyrian Empire maintained power for hundreds of years. But in the 600s B.C.E., the empire became too large to maintain, and it fell apart.

Answer: The Assyrian Empire faced several internal civil problems throughout its history. During the Early Assyrian Period, the empire became subject to the Akkadian Empire, which eventually fell due to economic decline, internal civil war, and attacks from the Gutian people. In the Neo-Assyrian Empire, after the death of Ashurbanipal, the empire experienced a severe decline marked by brutal civil wars involving three rival kings: Ashur-etil-ilani, Sin-shumu-lishir, and Sin-shar-ishkun. These internal conflicts weakened the empire, allowing other groups to take advantage and raid Assyrian territories. Ultimately, these internal struggles contributed to the downfall of the Assyrian Empire.

However, as Hernandez et al.

Hence, medical teams should not only teach common hypo- and hyperglycaemia symptoms to patients, but should also invite them to pay attention to their own peculiar perceptions of blood glucose levels and to build a more personalized, more efficient body cue repertoire (Hernandez et al. 1999).More generally, as suggested by the medical literature, glycaemia awareness can be classified as an interoceptive sense.

Answer: Interoception plays a role in hypoglycemia awareness by involving the perception of sensations originating from within the body, particularly related to the internal homeostatic state. It is classified as an interoceptive sense, which means it involves the awareness of internal bodily cues and signals. In the context of hypoglycemia awareness, interoception helps individuals perceive and recognize symptoms of low blood glucose levels, allowing them to respond appropriately. The medical literature suggests that glycaemia awareness, which includes hypoglycemia awareness, can be enhanced by paying attention to one's own unique perceptions and building a personalized body cue repertoire. This personalized awareness can improve the subjective awareness of hypoglycemia without negatively affecting glycemic control.

Answer: Interoception plays a significant role in hypoglycemia awareness as it involves the perception of sensations originating from within the body. This internal awareness is crucial for recognizing symptoms of low blood glucose levels. The context suggests that glycaemia awareness, which is an aspect of interoception, can be improved through structured education, technology, and clinical contact. This improvement in interoception can lead to better subjective awareness of hypoglycemia without negatively affecting glycemic control. Additionally, neuroimaging studies have shown that interventions can lead to increased cerebral blood flow in areas of the brain involved in autonomic control and interoception, further enhancing hypoglycemia awareness.

the workload and inspire other teammates to keep up the pace.

Example: Scheduling a reliable food service specialist to operate the cash register, serve customers, and stock supplies during lunchtime in a city’s business district.

#10: Involve the employees in the scheduling process

You probably don’t want to waste time on constant work schedule updates because your employees are always asking for shift swaps or deadline extensions.

To minimize this, you can aim to involve the employees in the process of creating work schedules as much as you find suitable.

1. Have someone assist you in scheduling

Colleagues are more likely to understand what their co-workers think about their schedules, so having someone from the “inside” directly assist you with the schedules is optimal. This way, you’ll find out whether members of your team:

Are satisfied with their appointed times

Want more or less time scheduled per week

Prefer other days or times for their schedules

2. Have the team
Answer: To manage and timetable subject-leadership time for staff in a small UK primary school without negatively impacting pupil outcomes or the work-life balance of teachers, the school could consider leveraging the principles of distributed leadership and flexible scheduling as observed during remote learning. Here are some strategies:

1. **Flexible Scheduling**: Allow teachers to have flexible schedules where part of the school day is dedicated to independent student activities such as reading, writing, or project work. This can free up time for teachers to engage in subject-leadership roles and collaborative planning without compromising teaching time.

2. **Collaborative Planning Time**: Schedule regular, dedicated time for teachers to collaborate and plan together. This could be during times when students are engaged in independent or group work, ensuring that teachers have the opportunity to share leadership responsibilities and support each other.

3. **Involve Teachers in Scheduling**: Involve teachers in the process of creating their schedules. This can help ensure that their preferences and needs are considered, leading to more satisfaction and better work-life balance. Teachers can provide input on when they are available for leadership tasks and when they prefer to focus on classroom teaching.

4. **Leverage Technology**: Use technology to facilitate communication and collaboration among teachers. Virtual meetings or collaborative platforms can be used to plan and discuss subject leadership tasks, reducing the need for in-person meetings and saving time.

5. **Distributed Leadership**: Encourage a culture of distributed leadership where informal leadership roles are recognized and valued. This can involve delegating certain leadership tasks to different teachers based on their strengths and interests, allowing for a more balanced distribution of responsibilities.

By implementing these strategies, the school can effectively manage subject-leadership time while maintaining a positive impact on both pupil outcomes and teacher work-life balance.

Answer: To manage subject-leadership time effectively in a small UK primary school without negatively impacting pupil outcomes or the work-life balance of teachers, the school could consider implementing distributed leadership. This approach involves sharing leadership responsibilities among staff to leverage their strengths and expertise. Here are some strategies based on the context provided:

1. **Autonomy**: Empower teachers by giving them the autonomy to lead in areas where they have expertise or interest. This can help them feel more invested and motivated, reducing the burden of leadership tasks.

2. **Capacity Building**: Provide professional development opportunities to build the capacity of teachers to take on leadership roles. This can include training in time management, leadership skills, and collaborative practices.

3. **Accountability**: Establish clear expectations and accountability measures for leadership roles. This ensures that responsibilities are managed effectively without overwhelming any single teacher.

4. **Flexible Scheduling**: Consider flexible scheduling to allow teachers dedicated time for leadership tasks. This might involve creative timetabling or using non-teaching staff to cover classes temporarily.

5. **Collaborative Planning**: Encourage collaborative planning sessions where teachers can work together to share ideas and resources, reducing individual workload and fostering a supportive environment.

6. **Use of Technology**: Leverage technology to facilitate communication and collaboration among staff, allowing for more efficient management of leadership tasks.

By adopting these strategies, the school can distribute leadership responsibilities more effectively, supporting both teacher well-being and student outcomes.

Historical Overview of Economics Humans first relied upon hunting and gathering to survive. Social systems of subsistence depended upon the family or small groups for food and did not have a recognizable economy. But through agriculture, specialization, settlement, and trade, an economy did emerge. With the development of agriculture came pastoral and horticultural societies with more dependable food supplies and surplus. This surplus allowed division of labor, and many in the society took on new roles—specializing in making clothes, tools, or shelter. People could settle in one place and begin producing a surplus of other goods, which in turn led to trade. The primary
Answer: Pre-historic humans began developing significantly after the Ice Age due to the warming climate, which made agriculture feasible. This transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to an agrarian society marked a major development in human history. The ability to cultivate crops and domesticate animals led to more dependable food supplies and surpluses, which allowed for the division of labor and specialization. As a result, humans could settle in one place, produce surplus goods, and engage in trade, leading to the emergence of recognizable economies and more complex social structures. This development was a key factor in the advancement of human societies after the Ice Age.

Answer: Pre-historic humans began to significantly develop after the Ice Age due to the warming climate, which made agriculture feasible. During the Ice Age, modern agriculture was not possible, and humans relied on hunting and gathering for survival. However, as the climate warmed, humans transitioned to an agrarian society, which allowed for more dependable food supplies and surpluses. This surplus enabled the division of labor and specialization, leading to the development of pastoral and horticultural societies. People could settle in one place, produce a surplus of goods, and engage in trade, marking the emergence of a recognizable economy. This transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to an agrarian society was a significant development in human history.

GraphRAG Score: 65Question: How can web developers balance the conflicting demands of user experience, security, and performance in developing modern web applications, and what trade offs are involved?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Security leaders often question why performance matters. In this blog, we will discuss the “tug of war” that exists between implementing robust security controls and delivering a superior user experience as we spotlight the findings from a new white paper from industry analyst IDC, and highlight why the design of the Netskope NewEdge infrastructure is so important to how we approach these challenges.

It’s important to get security decision-makers and practitioners to understand the serious risk that comes from degraded performance and why networking considerations are key. Without factoring in performance, the best-case scenario is that cloud security slows down the business. The worst-case scenario is that users bypass security controls altogether – ignoring hours of security awareness training–creating greater exposure for an organization and diminishing the return on their significant security investments.

Fortunately, in most opportunities I’ve come across at Netskope, the networking team plays an integral in influencing security decisions, especially when it comes to inline services like security service edge (SSE) and secure access service edge (SASE) architecture, as well as individual capabilities like secure web gateway (SWG), firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS) or zero trust network access (ZTNA).

Different mindsets: security vs. networking

While security teams typically focus on the depth and breadth of features for securing data, identifying threats, understanding application instances, or gleaning context for the best security efficacy, networking puts a spotlight on speeds and feeds. In short, how quickly can traffic get to the cloud, get the security processing needed, and get the user to the content, data, or app they are trying to access. For networkers, performance is all about delivering a high quality experience and it’s also why tools for remediating issues quickly (like Netskope’s Digital Experience Management) are so integral to cloud security purchase decisions.

As reported in the June 2022 results of a Dimensional Research survey, which polled more than 500 enterprise security and IT professionals, a mind-blowing 46% admitted to relaxing or bypassing security to improve user experience. To sum it up, nearly half admit to taking the easy, less secure and more convenient path for the sake of a better experience. It doesn’t take a security expert to recognize the dangers and risks associated with that trade-off. Fortunately the survey results make it clear the vast majority of customers (90%) believe end-to-end monitoring is needed to determine if security between their end-users and the cloud is impacting the quality of experience.

This is consistent with Gartner analysts forecasting that by 2025, half of IT organizations will have established a digital experience strategy, team, and management tool, up from 5% in 2021. It is also noteworthy that in the Dimensional Research survey upwards of 90% of respondents believe visibility into end-user experience will be imperative to SASE adoption and success.

Why should performance matter to both security and networking practitioners?

Shining a spotlight on the connection between security controls, cloud security performance, and ultimately user experience is the heart of a new paper from IDC analyst Chris Rodriguez. It’s a particularly timely topic with the shift to hybrid work and employees splitting their time between working remote and being on-premises, in the office. This is driving a corresponding spike in interest in digital experience monitoring solutions, as Rodriguez points out, “44% of customers admit hybrid work limits visibility” into user experience.

In the paper, Rodriguez says, “Security systems must provide protection without hindering business operations. History has shown that disruptive security tools may be set to monitor-only mode, avoided, or switched off entirely, leading to reduced security efficacy. Put simply, security must be accurate, reliable, performant, and frictionless. Security transformation must go beyond mere adaptation to technological change but must account for the “human factor” as well.”

An example of the risky trade-offs often made between security and experience–often illustrated by users doing not what is “safest” but what is most “convenient”–is what we’ve seen over the years with seatbelts. It wasn’t until laws were put in place, massive media campaigns educated individuals on the risk of driving sans seatbelt, and technology advancements (like automatic belts or audio alarms that notify drivers when they are not safely buckled in) were put in place that individuals took action. Yes it was a combination of education, but also things that made it easier (or more painful to not buckle up) that drove the right behavior and in this case the best security posture for drivers hitting the roads. Netskope CISO, EMEA Neil Thacker wrote about a similar concept in a recent blog, through the lens of the Halo safety measure in Formula 1 racing, comparing it to how minute controls and coaching can help lead to better security posture and business outcomes.

Many times this is what we’ve seen firsthand at Netskope, even working with some of the most security and compliance-minded enterprises in the world—including banks, healthcare providers and even government agencies. I experienced this shortly after joining Netskope when I learned of a customer prospect embarking on a web security proof of concept (POC) where employees were intentionally bypassing their VPNs to go direct-to-net, without any security protections (endpoint or otherwise) in place. It’s pretty clear the risk associated with this approach. The question I asked was “why did they choose this path”–avoiding using their VPN or the pains of multi-factor authentication? The short answer was because it was faster and more convenient. And this is why Rodriguez’s paper is such an important topic. Security and the performance required to deliver a superior experience are interconnected.

The right infrastructure for a superior digital experience

As a result of the $100M+ investment in building out its security private cloud called NewEdge, Netskope is particularly well-suited to help solve this inherent issue that comes with security transformation. NewEdge was designed to ensure cloud security is delivered without performance trade-offs. This strategy and level of investment further underscores why the underlying infrastructure is so important, not just for networkers but also security teams.

Rodriguez also wrote that “the digital transformation era also presents an opportunity for security providers [like Netskope] to address a long-standing trade-off in cybersecurity: performance versus protection… Now, the technological and operational changes introduced by digital transformation require security practitioners to consider performance in the context of the human factor. Through this lens, performance becomes a security imperative.“

Isn’t it about time as an industry that we fully recognize the weakest link of the “human factor” and work collectively to end the tug of war between security and performance? Customers can have both – the security they need and the digital experience their users expect. Accordingly, it’s also why customers, both security and networking leaders, need to pay attention to the underlying cloud security infrastructure that powers SSE and SASE to ensure there are no trade-offs.

Is it possible to meet user expectations and maintain SD-WAN security?

One benefit of SD-WAN is that it makes it easy to steer certain traffic from remote sites toward your on-premises data centers and steer other traffic from remote sites directly to the Internet. Once selective traffic steering is made easy, there’s less of a reason to backhaul Internet-bound traffic from remote sites through your data center. Doing so only adds latency between users and their Internet-hosted apps and adds unnecessary traffic on your network. Instead, steer Internet-bound traffic directly from the branch to the Internet. Less latency. Less overall network traffic. Better performance. There’s a catch, however.

The problem is that steering traffic directly from the branch to the Internet comes with it the cost of increasing the threat perimeter of your network. You’ve traded network security for app performance. In order to navigate this trade-off, let’s investigate the following:

What are the best ways to effectively protect the edges of my network without breaking the bank?

What if I have to continue backhauling Internet-bound traffic (e.g. due to regulatory compliance or corporate policy)?

Is there a way to overcome the negative effects of higher latency that may arise?

Protect the edges of your network without breaking the bank

A decision about which security solution(s) to use is a critical one for an IT department—and one which is rarely met with casual points of view. First of all, when considering network security services as part of an SD-WAN transformation, start by making sure your SD-WAN solution has you covered regardless of the path you choose. Namely…

Your SD-WAN solution should make it easy to service chain with 3 rd party security services, AND

party security services, AND Your SD-WAN should offer a set of native security functions out of the box

Let’s double click on each of those statements to further explore why it’s important and what to look for in each.

Your SD-WAN security should make it easy to service chain with third-party security services

It’s important that your SD-WAN solution does not require you to abandon the use of security services from vendors that are already in use and trusted within your organization. It’s typical (and recommended) that an SD-WAN transformation project be done in collaboration with the IT security team. They’re a critical stakeholder. You want to offload Internet-bound traffic at the source—near the user. They see that as throwing a bomb into their traditional approach to security, which looks to limit the number of access points to the big bad Internet.

As a starting point, look for an SD-WAN solution that enables the network team to meet your security team. Be mindful of the following:

Does the SD-WAN solution integrate with ANY other third-party security vendor products?

You’ll find that with basic SD-WAN solutions, as well as those offered by vendors who began their life as a network security vendor, that there’s little choice about which security solutions integrate well with the SD-WAN functions. This is obviously the least desirable scenario.

Does the SD-WAN solution integrate with a specific but limited number of third-party security vendor products?

Obviously, this is better than nothing but only works well if the integration includes support for the security vendor required by your security team.

Does the SD-WAN solution provide third-party security service chaining in a one-box configuration?

As you evaluate different SD-WAN offerings this is what really separates the wheat from the chaff. Very few SD-WAN solutions provide one-box service chaining supporting the integration of virtual instances of third-party security services. This can make a big difference in both the capital and operational cost of managing the edge of your network. Multiply the number of boxes in each site by the total number of sites and the numbers can get really big, really fast.

Your SD-WAN security should offer native security functions out of the box

While it’s often wise and pragmatic to first focus on integration with third-party security functions (e.g. from a vendor your security team already knows and/or uses), there’s an opportunity to further reduce total costs by leveraging native security functions provided by your SD-WAN solution out of the box. Look for SD-WAN solutions that provide a complete set of capabilities to maximize your savings, including:

Next-Gen Firewall

Next-Gen IPS/IDS

Malware Protection

Antivirus Protection

Unified Threat Management

Deliver exceptional user experience for backhauled Internet traffic

While SD-WAN may unlock new opportunities to steer Internet-bound traffic from remote sites directly to the Internet, bypassing any backhaul to a centralized data center or hub, it’s unlikely this will happen all at once for all traffic types. It’s more likely that many sites will continue to backhaul for some time (e.g. those that haven’t yet migrated to SD-WAN). Even once a site has migrated to SD-WAN, it’s likely that certain Internet-bound traffic will continue to be backhauled. For example, a business application delivered via SaaS may be more trustworthy than recreational Internet traffic. In this case, it’s prudent to keep backhauling all Internet-bound traffic except for a specific whitelist of apps that are steered directly from the branch to the Internet.

Every site and/or app that leverages backhauling will continue to face higher latency vs. direct steering from the branch. And, if the backhauled traffic is traversing conventional circuits (e.g. MPLS), you may also be facing bandwidth constraints as well.

Your SD-WAN solution should overcome high latency and limited bandwidth for backhauled traffic

Most SD-WAN solutions use app-centric policies to determine when Internet-bound packets are steered directly from branch to the Internet or backhauled. But, once the packets are placed on the network, the user’s experience is entirely determined by circuit conditions of the chosen path.

Look for an SD-WAN solution that offers WAN optimization and app acceleration services, especially for SaaS and cloud-hosted apps.

SD-WAN security and user experience should not be a trade-off

As you modernize your WAN, you will face trade-offs between network security and user experience / app performance. There’s no question about that. However, you can break through these trade-offs so long as your SD-WAN solution provides the right set of capabilities. Ensure your solution supports: (i) extensible service chaining, (ii) advanced native security functions and (iii) app acceleration for SaaS/cloud-based apps.

With those capabilities in hand, you’ll have the freedom to transform your WAN over time. You can maintain SD-WAN security requirements AND meeting user expectations for fast and reliable app performance.

Answer: Web developers can balance the conflicting demands of user experience, security, and performance in developing modern web applications by carefully considering the trade-offs involved and implementing strategies that address each aspect effectively. Here are some ways to achieve this balance:

1. **Prioritize Security Without Compromising Performance:**
   - Implement robust security measures that do not significantly degrade performance. For example, use efficient encryption algorithms and optimize security checks to minimize latency.
   - Consider using security solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, such as SD-WAN solutions that support third-party security service chaining.

2. **Enhance User Experience While Maintaining Security:**
   - Ensure that security measures do not hinder user experience. For instance, avoid overly complex authentication processes that frustrate users.
   - Use technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and adaptive authentication to streamline the user experience while maintaining security.

3. **Optimize Performance Without Sacrificing Security:**
   - Use performance optimization techniques such as caching, content delivery networks (CDNs), and efficient coding practices to enhance application speed.
   - Implement end-to-end monitoring to identify and address performance bottlenecks that may arise from security processes.

4. **Trade-offs Involved:**
   - **Security vs. Performance:** Implementing strong security measures can sometimes slow down application performance. Developers need to find a balance where security is not compromised, but performance remains acceptable.
   - **User Experience vs. Security:** Enhancing security can lead to a more complex user experience, such as requiring multi-factor authentication. Developers must ensure that security measures are user-friendly and do not deter users.
   - **Performance vs. User Experience:** Optimizing for performance might involve reducing the complexity of user interfaces or limiting certain features, which can impact the overall user experience.

By carefully evaluating these trade-offs and leveraging technologies that support both security and performance, web developers can create applications that meet user expectations while maintaining a strong security posture.

Answer: Web developers can balance the conflicting demands of user experience, security, and performance in modern web applications by carefully considering the trade-offs and implementing strategies that address each aspect effectively. Here are some key points and trade-offs involved:

1. **User Experience vs. Security**: Enhancing user experience often involves reducing friction, such as minimizing login steps or simplifying navigation. However, this can sometimes lead to relaxed security measures. Developers can address this by implementing user-friendly security features like single sign-on (SSO) or biometric authentication, which maintain security without compromising user experience.

2. **Performance vs. Security**: Security measures can sometimes slow down application performance, such as when data encryption or complex authentication processes are involved. To balance this, developers can optimize code, use efficient algorithms, and leverage technologies like content delivery networks (CDNs) to improve performance while maintaining robust security.

3. **User Experience vs. Performance**: A rich user experience with high-quality graphics and animations can impact performance, leading to slower load times. Developers can mitigate this by optimizing assets, using lazy loading techniques, and ensuring responsive design to maintain a smooth user experience without sacrificing performance.

4. **Trade-offs**: The primary trade-off involves finding the right balance between these elements. For instance, prioritizing security might mean accepting slightly longer load times, while focusing on performance might require simplifying certain security protocols. Developers must assess the specific needs and risks of their application to make informed decisions.

By leveraging modern tools and technologies, such as progressive web apps (PWAs), developers can create applications that offer a seamless user experience, robust security, and optimal performance. Additionally, continuous monitoring and iterative improvements based on user feedback and security assessments can help maintain this balance over time.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Solvent effect on selectivity

The Pd catalyst was prepared on an α-Al 2 O 3 substrate (Supplementary Fig. 1) through a series of sequential incipient wetness impregnation steps (Supplementary Fig. 2). Figure 2 presents a TEM image of the 3% Pd/α-Al 2 O 3 sample. A histogram of Pd particle diameter distribution resulting from counting 100 particles is included. The calculated volume-weighted averaged particle size is 4.4 nm (Supplementary Fig. 3). Figure 2c shows the FAL conversion and product yields in two different solvents (cyclohexane and water). Cyclohexane was chosen as a representative organic solution because of its moderate miscibility with furfural. When using decalin as the solvent (Supplementary Fig. 4) a fast catalyst deactivation was observed, probably due to the low solubility of furfural in this solvent that enhanced deposition on the catalyst surface and polymerization of reactants and reaction intermediates. In agreement with previous studies37, the only products observed, in both cyclohexane and water, were FOL, THFAL and THFOL. The average carbon balance in all the runs was around 95%. Figure 2c also shows that THFAL is the main product in cyclohexane, suggesting that furanyl ring hydrogenation (Fig. 2a) is preferred in this solvent. Distinctly, when the reaction was carried out in water, a protic polar solvent, the furfural conversion was twice as high as in cyclohexane (Fig. 2c). Moreover, a dramatic difference in selectivity was observed. That is, at comparable conversion levels, although in cyclohexane the dominant product was THFAL, the main product observed in water was FOL, which is generated via hydrogenation of the carbonyl group, rather than the furanyl ring. Note there is also increased production of the fully hydrogenated product, THFOL, which is produced predominately from FOL (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6).

Furthermore, Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 7 show that, at similar overall furfural conversion (~10%), the reaction order with respect to the pressure of H 2 was about 0.3 in cyclohexane and 0.8 in water, indicating different rate-limiting steps in the two solvents. That is, hydrogenation of the C=O requires two sequential steps (hydrogenation of the C and the O in the carbonyl group, Fig. 3a). If, after eliminating the mass transport limitation (Supplementary Fig. 8), the first hydrogenation is rate limiting, the reaction order in H 2 should be approximately half at low H 2 pressure (see Supplementary equation (10), derived based on a two-site model36,38 in the Supplementary Methods). By contrast, if the second hydrogenation is rate limiting, the reaction rate should be first order in H 2 pressure (that is, one half for each step, as shown in Supplementary equation (11) in the Supplementary Methods). The different reaction orders indeed indicate that the rate-limiting steps for furfural hydrogenation are different in water and in cyclohexane. Furthermore, to emphasize the role of water, we conducted reactions in deuterated water (D 2 O) under the same reaction conditions (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). However, we found that a fast H/D exchange between the product alcohol and the solvent made it challenging to unambiguously demonstrate the role of water.

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of furfural in an explicit water solvent

We explored these solvent effects by using computational calculations. We first performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations for H 2 on a Pd(111) surface at various temperatures. As expected, at the operating temperatures of typical catalytic reactions, we found that H 2 rapidly dissociates on Pd(111) (Supplementary Fig. 11). In the absence of liquid water, we found that, in agreement with previous calculations22, the most stable adsorption configuration of FAL on Pd(111) is one with the furanyl ring lying parallel to the surface. Similarly, at the water–-Pd(111) interface, we observed that furfural adopts a configuration with the furanyl ring almost parallel to the surface, but with the aldehyde group tilted up slightly, towards the water phase (Supplementary Data 1). That is, the interaction with water in close proximity lifts the oxygen from the surface, weakening the interaction with the metal surface, which may facilitate its hydrogenation (see the below section, Free energy calculations of different hydrogenation routes)39. The AIMD energy profile at the reaction temperature of furfural in both water and at the water–Pd interface is shown in Supplementary Fig. 12. By analysing the snapshots from the AIMD simulations (Supplementary Fig. 12), we find that furfural in water is about 17 kJ mol−1 more stable than when positioned at the water–Pd interface, indicating that partition of furfural on the Pd surface is comparable to solvation in water (Supplementary Data 2).

Free energy calculations of different hydrogenation routes

Figure 3 shows the calculated free energies of furfural hydrogenation with and without liquid water. In these calculations, the H atoms adsorbed on the surface directly participate in hydrogenation (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 13). We find that the sequential hydrogenation of the O atom followed by the C atom in the carbonyl group has an overall free energy barrier of 46 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 3c). The opposite sequence, that is, C first and O second, has a much higher activation barrier (Supplementary Fig. 14). Therefore, in the ensuing discussion, we only focus on the former reaction pathway, with O and then C hydrogenated sequentially, because the barrier for the latter is higher.

In liquid water, the overall activation barrier decreases significantly (Fig. 3c). The surface reaction becomes more exothermic in water than on a clean Pd(111) surface. This favoured energetics results from the stabilization of the reaction intermediate (IMT) and the surface-bound FOL by the water phase. Figure 3d,e shows that neighbouring water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the intermediate and the product FOL. Because of this stabilization effect of the IMT, the energy of the transition state in the oxygen hydrogenation step is reduced by 50 kJ mol−1 and becomes very close to that of the sequential carbon hydrogenation step. In this scenario, water does not participate directly in any of the reaction steps, but its presence changes the energetics of the adsorbed intermediate and surface-bound product.

In the second scenario, theoretical calculations suggest that a water molecule can directly participate in the reaction, as shown in Fig. 3b. Specifically, a water molecule adsorbed in the proximity of furfural can form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group and, in the liquid phase, can take the H atom directly from the surface, while transferring one of its original H atoms to the carbonyl group, via the aforementioned hydrogen bond. The atomic structures are shown in Supplementary Fig. 15. The transition state includes a proton bound to a water molecule and a negative charge remaining in the metal (Supplementary Fig. 16). In this case, the water molecule is within the first solvation shell and acts as a bridge between the carbonyl group and the surface H atom. The barrier for oxygen hydrogenation is further reduced by 7 kJ mol−1. The hydrogenation of carbon becomes the rate-limiting step (Fig. 3c). Because of the dynamic nature of the H transfer process, the H atom carries no dynamic ‘memory’ of its origins at the surface. We also observe that, though only one water molecule directly participates in the reaction, the aqueous environment helps in stabilizing the transition state: the true activation barrier for the first hydrogenation step in liquid water is lower than that when only a single water molecule is present. Supplementary Fig. 16 shows the charge density difference between this H 3 O+ species and the remaining part of the transition state. The stabilization of the transition state in liquid water is caused by the dielectric screening of the liquid water, which is manifested by a noticeable charge redistribution between water molecules and the H 3 O+ species (Supplementary Fig. 16). This observation agrees with well-studied static and dynamic solvent-induced charge stabilization and redistribution in homogeneous catalysis40,41. Furthermore, the stabilization of the hydrogenated intermediate and FOL by liquid water through hydrogen bonding results in a lower true activation barrier for the hydrogenation of the C atom in water (47 kJ mol−1) compared to the single water case (67 kJ mol−1) (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Additionally, we find that the liquid-phase water molecule that is outside the first solvation shell and does not form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group can also pick up a surface hydrogen to form H 3 O+, leaving an electron in the metal reservoir. This hydrogen-uptake step is the same as the Volmer step in any conventional electrochemical hydrogen oxidation reaction42. Once the surface H atom becomes a proton in solution, it can be shuttled through a hydrogen-bonded water network via the well-known Grotthuss mechanism, with a low activation barrier of around 10 kJ mol−1 (ref. 43). When the proton reaches a water molecule that forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group, we find that the protonation step (and simultaneously charge neutralization by the metal substrate) is barrierless. This shuttling scenario reduces the energy of the transition state for the oxygen hydrogenation by 12 kJ mol−1 as compared to the direct surface hydrogenation mechanism (Fig. 3c). This process involves a series of proton transfers and is more likely to happen than the second scenario of a single-step water-assistant proton transfer. Note that in all the reaction paths involving a water-mediated H transfer, the second hydrogenation step—hydrogenation of the C in the aldehyde group—is the rate-determining step. This C atom does not form hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring H 2 O molecules, and thus its hydrogenation is only affected indirectly by the modified adsorption configuration of the intermediate and final products. The more stabilized hydrogenation products via the hydrogen bonds and the positively charged transition states by the dielectric screening work synergistically to reduce the energy of the transition state by more than 50 kJ mol−1 as compared to the water-free reaction path (Fig. 3c). Note that the mechanism suggested here follows a conventional proton-coupled electron transfer, typically proposed for electrochemical reactions44. The description of the exact charge transfer process occurring at the interface is beyond the scope of this work.

Microkinetic analysis

To further identify the most likely reaction pathways, maximum rate analysis has been performed45. Accordingly, we calculated the maximum rate of each elementary step, assuming in each case that this step is rate limiting while all the others are equilibrated (see Supplementary Methods). We find that, in the absence of water, the slowest step is the first one—oxygen hydrogenation—and the maximum rate of this step is lower than the C hydrogenation by about an order of magnitude (Supplementary Table 1). On the contrary, in the presence of water, the rate of O hydrogenation is significantly enhanced due to the reduced activation barrier. The maximum rate of O hydrogenation is about two orders of magnitude higher than hydrogenation of the C. That is, the latter becomes rate limiting, indicating a first-order dependence with respect to the pressure of H 2 . This conclusion holds true for both mechanisms involving water-mediated proton transfer, and is also true when considering all the O hydrogenation paths occurring in parallel. The maximum rate analysis thus agrees well with the experimental finding of approximately half order in H 2 in the absence of water and about first order in H 2 in the presence of water. This analysis thus suggests that the hydrogenation reaction of the aldehyde group is more likely to involve a water-mediated hydrogenation route for the O atom and surface-mediated hydrogenation path for the C atom, as summarized in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4: Reaction scheme for the hydrogenation of furfural over a metal surface in water. Water directly participates in the key elementary steps. Both surface- and solvent-mediated hydrogenation paths are involved but play different roles for hydrogenation of C and O atoms in the aldehyde group. Full size image

By contrast, in the hydrogenation of furfural in cyclohexane, ring hydrogenation becomes the dominant reaction pathway. The calculated free energy profile suggests that, in the absence of water, the first hydrogenation step has the highest apparent barrier (Supplementary Fig. 17), supporting the experimental finding that the reaction is approximately half order in cyclohexane. This calculation was performed without explicitly including the cyclohexane solvent, the role of which we consider is merely competing for surface sites46. Although the exact free energy profile in cyclohexane may be different from this clean surface calculation, the trend should be the same.
Answer: Based on the provided context, it would be best to start with solvent studies. The context highlights the significant impact of solvent choice on the selectivity and reaction pathways in the hydrogenation of furfural. Different solvents, such as cyclohexane and water, lead to different dominant products and reaction mechanisms. Understanding the solvent effects can provide valuable insights into optimizing reaction conditions and improving selectivity for desired products. Therefore, starting with solvent studies would be a logical approach to gain a deeper understanding of the catalytic process.

Answer: Some proposed solutions to the hard problem of consciousness include:

1. **Weak Reductionism**: This view suggests that the hard problem of consciousness is an epistemic issue that won't be directly solved by scientific progress due to our conceptualization, rather than an ontological gap.

2. **Idealism**: This traditional solution posits that consciousness is fundamental and not merely an emergent property of matter, thereby avoiding the hard problem entirely.

3. **Dualism**: This perspective views consciousness as either a non-physical substance separate from the brain or a non-physical property of the physical brain.

Install .NET on Windows

Article

06/28/2023

13 contributors Feedback

In this article

In this article, you'll learn how to install .NET on Windows. .NET is made up of the runtime and the SDK. The runtime is used to run a .NET app and may or may not be included with the app. The SDK is used to create .NET apps and libraries. The .NET runtime is always installed with the SDK.

The latest version of .NET is 7.

There are two types of supported releases, Long Term Support (LTS) releases or Standard Term Support (STS). The quality of all releases is the same. The only difference is the length of support. LTS releases get free support and patches for 3 years. STS releases get free support and patches for 18 months. For more information, see .NET Support Policy.

The following table lists the support status of each version of .NET (and .NET Core):

✔️ Supported ❌ Unsupported 7 (STS) 5 6 (LTS) 3.1 3.0 2.1 2.0 1.1 1.0

Install with Windows Package Manager (winget)

You can install and manage .NET through the Windows Package Manager service, using the winget tool. For more information about how to install and use winget, see Use the winget tool.

If you're installing .NET system-wide, install with administrative privileges.

Install the SDK

The .NET SDK allows you to develop apps with .NET. If you install the .NET SDK, you don't need to install the corresponding runtimes. To install the .NET SDK, run the following command:

winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.7

Install the runtime

For Windows, there are three .NET runtimes you can install. You should install both the .NET Desktop Runtime and the ASP.NET Core Runtime to ensure that you're compatible with all types of .NET apps.

.NET Desktop Runtime This runtime includes the base .NET runtime, and supports Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms apps that are built with .NET. This isn't the same as .NET Framework, which comes with Windows. winget install Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.7

ASP.NET Core Runtime This runtime includes the base .NET runtime, and runs web server apps. The ASP.NET Core Runtime allows you to run apps that were made with .NET that didn't provide the runtime. The following commands install the ASP.NET Core Runtime, which is the most compatible runtime for .NET. In your terminal, run the following commands: winget install Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.7

.NET Runtime This is the base runtime, and contains just the components needed to run a console app. Typically, you'd install the other runtimes. winget install Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.7

You can install preview versions of the runtimes by substituting the version number, such as 6 , with the word Preview . The following example installs the preview release of the .NET Desktop Runtime:

winget install Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.Preview

Install alongside Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a powerful and lightweight source code editor that runs on your desktop. Visual Studio Code is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

While Visual Studio Code doesn't come with an automated .NET Core installer like Visual Studio does, adding .NET Core support is simple.

Install with Windows Installer

The download page for .NET provides Windows Installer executables.

[IMPORTANT] Starting in November 2021, you can't change the installation path of .NET with the Windows Installer package. To install .NET to a different path, use the dotnet-install scripts.

If you want to install .NET silently, such as in a production environment or to support continuous integration, use the following switches:

/install

Installs .NET.

/quiet

Prevents any UI and prompts from displaying.

/norestart

Suppresses any attempts to restart.

dotnet-sdk-7.0.100-win-x64.exe /install /quiet /norestart

For more information, see Standard Installer Command-Line Options.

Tip The installer returns an exit code of 0 for success and an exit code of 3010 to indicate that a restart is required. Any other value is generally an error code.

Install with PowerShell automation

The dotnet-install scripts are used for CI automation and non-admin installs of the runtime. You can download the script from the dotnet-install script reference page.

The script defaults to installing the latest long term support (LTS) version, which is .NET 6. You can choose a specific release by specifying the Channel switch. Include the Runtime switch to install a runtime. Otherwise, the script installs the SDK.

The following command installs the ASP.NET Core runtime for maximum compatibility. The ASP.NET Core runtime also includes the standard .NET runtime.

dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel 7.0 -Runtime aspnetcore

Install the SDK by omitting the -Runtime switch. The -Channel switch is set in this example to STS , which installs the latest Standard Term Support version (.NET 7).

dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel STS

Install with Visual Studio

If you're using Visual Studio to develop .NET apps, the following table describes the minimum required version of Visual Studio based on the target .NET SDK version.

.NET SDK version Visual Studio version 7 Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4 or higher. 6 Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 or higher. 5 Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 or higher. 3.1 Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 or higher. 3.0 Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3 or higher. 2.2 Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9 or higher. 2.1 Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or higher.

If you already have Visual Studio installed, you can check your version with the following steps.

Open Visual Studio. Select Help > About Microsoft Visual Studio. Read the version number from the About dialog.

Visual Studio can install the latest .NET SDK and runtime.

Select a workload

When installing or modifying Visual Studio, select one or more of the following workloads, depending on the kind of application you're building:

The .NET Core cross-platform development workload in the Other Toolsets section.

workload in the section. The ASP.NET and web development workload in the Web & Cloud section.

workload in the section. The Azure development workload in the Web & Cloud section.

workload in the section. The .NET desktop development workload in the Desktop & Mobile section.

Supported releases

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases and the versions of Windows they're supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of .NET reaches end-of-support or the version of Windows reaches end-of-life.

Windows 10 versions end-of-service dates are segmented by edition. Only Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations editions are considered in the following table. Check the Windows lifecycle fact sheet for specific details.

Tip A + symbol represents the minimum version.

Operating System .NET 7 .NET 6 Windows 11 ✔️ ✔️ Windows Server 2022 ✔️ ✔️ Windows Server, Version 1903 or later ✔️ ✔️ Windows 10, Version 1607 or later ✔️ ✔️ Windows 8.1 ❌ ✔️ Windows 7 SP1 ESU ❌ ✔️ Windows Server 2019

The table in that section links to the downloads and checksum files for each .NET 7 release: Select the link for the version of .NET that you downloaded. The previous section used .NET SDK 7.0.304, which is in the .NET 7.0.7 release. Tip If you're not sure which .NET release contains your checksum file, explore the links until you find it. In the release page, you can see the .NET Runtime and .NET SDK version, and a link to the checksum file: Copy the link to the checksum file. Use the following script, but replace the link to download the appropriate checksum file: Invoke-WebRequest https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/7.0.7-sha.txt -OutFile 7.0.7-sha.txt With both the checksum file and the .NET release file downloaded to the same directory, search the checksum file for the checksum of the .NET download: When validation passes, you see True printed: > (Get-Content .\7.0.7-sha.txt | Select-String "dotnet-sdk-7.0.304-win-x64.exe").Line -like (Get-FileHash .\dotnet-sdk-7.0.304-win-x64.exe -Algorithm SHA512).Hash + "*" True If you see False printed, the file you downloaded isn't valid and shouldn't be used.

Runtime information

The runtime is used to run apps created with .NET. When an app author publishes an app, they can include the runtime with their app. If they don't include the runtime, it's up to the user to install the runtime.

There are three different runtimes you can install on Windows:

ASP.NET Core runtime

Runs ASP.NET Core apps. Includes the .NET runtime.

Desktop runtime

Runs .NET WPF and Windows Forms desktop apps for Windows. Includes the .NET runtime.

.NET runtime

This runtime is the simplest runtime and doesn't include any other runtime. It's highly recommended that you install both ASP.NET Core runtime and Desktop runtime for the best compatibility with .NET apps.

SDK information

The SDK is used to build and publish .NET apps and libraries. Installing the SDK includes all three runtimes: ASP.NET Core, Desktop, and .NET.

Arm-based Windows PCs

The following sections describe things you should consider when installing .NET on an Arm-based Windows PC.

What's supported

The following table describes which versions of .NET are supported on an Arm-based Windows PC:

.NET Version Architecture SDK Runtime Path conflict 7 Arm64 Yes Yes No 7 x64 Yes Yes No 6 Arm64 Yes Yes No 6 x64 Yes Yes No 5 Arm64 Yes Yes Yes 5 x64 No Yes Yes

Starting with .NET 6, the x64 and Arm64 versions of the .NET SDK exist independently from each other. If a new version is released, each architecture install needs to be upgraded.

Path differences

On an Arm-based Windows PC, all Arm64 versions of .NET are installed to the normal C:\Program Files\dotnet\ folder. However, when you install the x64 version of .NET 6 SDK or .NET 7 SDK, it's installed to the C:\Program Files\dotnet\x64\ folder.

Path conflicts

Starting with .NET 6, the x64 .NET SDK installs to its own directory, as described in the previous section. This allows the Arm64 and x64 versions of the .NET SDK to exist on the same machine. However, any x64 SDK prior to 6 isn't supported and installs to the same location as the Arm64 version, the C:\Program Files\dotnet\ folder. If you want to install an unsupported x64 SDK, you'll need to first uninstall the Arm64 version. The opposite is also true, you'll need to uninstall the unsupported x64 SDK to install the Arm64 version.

Path variables

Environment variables that add .NET to system path, such as the PATH variable, may need to be changed if you have both the x64 and Arm64 versions of the .NET SDK installed. Additionally, some tools rely on the DOTNET_ROOT environment variable, which would also need to be updated to point to the appropriate .NET SDK installation folder.

Dependencies

.NET 7

.NET 6 The following Windows versions are supported with .NET 7: Note A + symbol represents the minimum version. OS Version Architectures Windows 11 21H2+ x64, Arm64 Windows 10 Client 1607+ x64, x86, Arm64 Windows Server 2012+ x64, x86 Windows Server Core 2012+ x64, x86 Nano Server 1809+ x64 For more information about .NET 7 supported operating systems, distributions, and lifecycle policy, see .NET 7 Supported OS Versions. The following Windows versions are supported with .NET 6: Note A + symbol represents the minimum version. OS Version Architectures Windows 11 21H2+ x64, Arm64 Windows 10 Client 1607+ x64, x86, Arm64 Windows Client 7 SP1+, 8.1 x64, x86 Windows Server 2012+ x64, x86 Windows Server Core 2012+ x64, x86 Nano Server 1809+ x64 For more information about .NET 6 supported operating systems, distributions, and lifecycle policy, see .NET 6 Supported OS Versions. Offline install for Windows 7 Important This section only applies to .NET Core 2.1. When doing an offline install for .NET Core 2.1 on Windows 7, you'll first need to make sure that the latest Microsoft Root Certificate Authority 2011 has been installed on the target machine. The certmgr.exe tool can automate installing a certificate and is obtained from Visual Studio or the Windows SDK. The following command is used to install the certificate before running the .NET Core 2.1 installer: certmgr.exe /add MicRooCerAut2011_2011_03_22.crt /s /r localMachine root Be sure to review the dependencies required for Windows 7 below.

Windows 7 / 8.1 / Server 2012

More dependencies are required if you're installing the .NET SDK or runtime on the following Windows versions:

The previous requirements are also required if you receive an error related to either of the following dlls:

api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll

api-ms-win-cor-timezone-l1-1-0.dll

hostfxr.dll

Docker

Containers provide a lightweight way to isolate your application from the rest of the host system. Containers on the same machine share just the kernel and use resources given to your application.

.NET can run in a Docker container. Official .NET Docker images are published to the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) and are discoverable at the Microsoft .NET Docker Hub repository. Each repository contains images for different combinations of the .NET (SDK or Runtime) and OS that you can use.

Microsoft provides images that are tailored for specific scenarios. For example, the ASP.NET Core repository provides images that are built for running ASP.NET Core apps in production.

For more information about using .NET in a Docker container, see Introduction to .NET and Docker and Samples.

Troubleshooting

After installing the .NET SDK, you may run into problems trying to run .NET CLI commands. This section collects those common problems and provides solutions.

It was not possible to find any installed .NET Core SDKs

Most likely you've installed both the x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit) versions of the .NET SDK. This is causing a conflict because when you run the dotnet command it's resolving to the x86 version when it should resolve to the x64 version. This is usually fixed by adjusting the %PATH% variable to resolve the x64 version first.

Verify that you have both versions installed by running the where.exe dotnet command. If you do, you should see an entry for both the Program Files\ and Program Files (x86)\ folders. If the Program Files (x86)\ folder is first as indicated by the following example, it's incorrect and you should continue on to the next step. > where.exe dotnet C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\dotnet.exe C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe If it's correct and the Program Files\ is first, you don't have the problem this section is discussing and you should create a .NET help request issue on GitHub Press the Windows button and type "Edit the system environment variables" into search. Select Edit the system environment variables. The System Properties window opens up to the Advanced Tab. Select Environment Variables. On the Environment Variables window, under the System variables group, select the Path* row and then select the Edit button. Use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to move the C:\Program Files\dotnet\ entry above C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\.

The runtime is used to run a .NET app and may or may not be included with the app. The SDK is used to create .NET apps and libraries. The .NET runtime is always installed with the SDK.\\n\\nThe latest version of .NET is 7.\\n\\nThere are two types of supported releases, Long Term Support (LTS) releases or Standard Term Support (STS). The quality of all releases is the same. The only difference is the length of support. LTS releases get free support and patches for 3 years. STS releases get free support and patches for 18 months. For more information, see .NET Support Policy.\\n\\nThe following table lists the support status of each version of .NET (and .NET Core):\\n\\n✔️ Supported ❌ Unsupported 7 (STS) 5 6 (LTS) 3.1 3.0 2.1 2.0 1.1 1.0\\n\\nInstall with Windows Package Manager (winget)\\n\\nYou can install and manage .NET through the Windows Package Manager service, using the winget tool. For more information about how to install and use winget, see Use the winget tool.\\n\\nIf you\\\'re installing .NET system-wide, install with administrative privileges.\\n\\nInstall the SDK\\n\\nThe .NET SDK allows you to develop apps with .NET. If you install the .NET SDK, you don\\\'t need to install the corresponding runtimes. To install the .NET SDK, run the following command:\\n\\nwinget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.7\\n\\nInstall the runtime\\n\\nFor Windows, there are three .NET runtimes you can install. You should install both the .NET Desktop Runtime and the ASP.NET Core Runtime to ensure that you\\\'re compatible with all types of .NET apps.\\n\\n.NET Desktop Runtime This runtime includes the base .NET runtime, and supports Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms apps that are built with .NET. This isn\\\'t the same as .NET Framework, which comes with Windows. winget install Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.7\\n\\nASP.NET Core Runtime This runtime includes the base .NET runtime, and runs web server apps. The ASP.NET Core Runtime allows you to run apps that were made with .NET that didn\\\'t provide the runtime. The following commands install the ASP.NET Core Runtime, which is the most compatible runtime for .NET. In your terminal, run the following commands: winget install Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.7\\n\\n.NET Runtime This is the base runtime, and contains just the components needed to run a console app. Typically, you\\\'d install the other runtimes. winget install Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.7\\n\\nYou can install preview versions of the runtimes by substituting the version number, such as 6 , with the word Preview . The following example installs the preview release of the .NET Desktop Runtime:\\n\\nwinget install Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.Preview\\n\\nInstall alongside Visual Studio Code\\n\\nVisual Studio Code is a powerful and lightweight source code editor that runs on your desktop. Visual Studio Code is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\\n\\nWhile Visual Studio Code doesn\\\'t come with an automated .NET Core installer like Visual Studio does, adding .NET Core support is simple.\\n\\nInstall with Windows Installer\\n\\nThe download page for .NET provides Windows Installer executables.\\n\\n[IMPORTANT] Starting in November 2021, you can\\\'t change the installation path of .NET with the Windows Installer package. To install .NET to a different path, use the dotnet-install scripts.\\n\\nIf you want to install .NET silently, such as in a production environment or to support continuous integration, use the following switches:\\n\\n/install\\n\\nInstalls .NET.\\n\\n/quiet\\n\\nPrevents any UI and prompts from displaying.\\n\\n/norestart\\n\\nSuppresses any attempts to restart.\\n\\ndotnet-sdk-7.0.100-win-x64.exe /install /quiet /norestart\\n\\nFor more information, see Standard Installer Command-Line Options.\\n\\nTip The installer returns an exit code of 0 for success and an exit code of 3010 to indicate that a restart is required. Any other value is generally an error code.\\n\\nInstall with PowerShell automation\\n\\nThe dotnet-install scripts are used for CI automation and non-admin installs of the runtime. You can download the script from the dotnet-install script reference page.\\n\\nThe script defaults to installing the latest long term support (LTS) version, which is .NET 6. You can choose a specific release by specifying the Channel switch. Include the Runtime switch to install a runtime. Otherwise, the script installs the SDK.\\n\\nThe following command installs the ASP.NET Core runtime for maximum compatibility. The ASP.NET Core runtime also includes the standard .NET runtime.\\n\\ndotnet-install.ps1 -Channel 7.0 -Runtime aspnetcore\\n\\nInstall the SDK by omitting the -Runtime switch. The -Channel switch is set in this example to STS , which installs the latest Standard Term Support version (.NET 7).\\n\\ndotnet-install.ps1 -Channel STS\\n\\nInstall with Visual Studio\\n\\nIf you\\\'re using Visual Studio to develop .NET apps, the following table describes the minimum required version of Visual Studio based on the target .NET SDK version.\\n\\n.NET SDK version Visual Studio version 7 Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4 or higher. 6 Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 or higher. 5 Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 or higher. 3.1 Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 or higher. 3.0 Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3 or higher. 2.2 Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9 or higher. 2.1 Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or higher.\\n\\nIf you already have Visual Studio installed, you can check your version with the following steps.\\n\\nOpen Visual Studio. Select Help > About Microsoft Visual Studio. Read the version number from the About dialog.\\n\\nVisual Studio can install the latest .NET SDK and runtime.\\n\\nSelect a workload\\n\\nWhen installing or modifying Visual Studio, select one or more of the following workloads, depending on the kind of application you\\\'re building:\\n\\nThe .NET Core cross-platform development workload in the Other Toolsets section.\\n\\nworkload in the section. The ASP.NET and web development workload in the Web & Cloud section.\\n\\nworkload in the section. The Azure development workload in the Web & Cloud section.\\n\\nworkload in the section. The .NET desktop development workload in the Desktop & Mobile section.\\n\\nSupported releases\\n\\nThe following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases and the versions of Windows they\\\'re supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of .NET reaches end-of-support or the version of Windows reaches end-of-life.\\n\\nWindows 10 versions end-of-service dates are segmented by edition. Only Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations editions are considered in the following table. Check the Windows lifecycle fact sheet for specific details.\\n\\nTip A + symbol represents the minimum version.\\n\\nOperating System .NET 7 .NET 6 Windows 11 ✔️ ✔️ Windows Server 2022 ✔️ ✔️ Windows Server, Version 1903 or later ✔️ ✔️ Windows 10, Version 1607 or later ✔️ ✔️ Windows 8.1 ❌ ✔️ Windows 7 SP1 ESU ❌ ✔️ Windows Server 2019\\n\\nWindows Server 2016\\n\\nWindows Server 2012 R2\\n\\nWindows Server 2012 ✔️ Windows Server Core 2012 R2 ✔️ ✔️ Windows Server Core 2012 ✔️ ✔️ Nano Server, Version 1809+ ✔️ ✔️ Nano Server, Version 1803 ❌ ❌\\n\\nFor more information about .NET 7 supported operating systems, distributions, and lifecycle policy, see .NET 7 Supported OS Versions.\\n\\nUnsupported releases\\n\\nThe following versions of .NET are ❌ no longer supported:\\n\\n.NET 5\\n\\n.NET Core 3.1\\n\\n.NET Core 3.0\\n\\n.NET Core 2.2\\n\\n.NET Core 2.1\\n\\n.NET Core 2.0\\n\\nVerify downloaded binaries\\n\\nAfter downloading an installer, verify it to make sure that the file hasn\\\'t been changed or corrupted. You can verify the checksum on your computer and then compare it to what was reported on the download website.\\n\\nWhen you download an installer or binary from an official download page, the checksum for the file is displayed. Select the Copy button to copy the checksum value to your clipboard.\\n\\nYou can use PowerShell or Command Prompt to validate the checksum of the file you\\\'ve downloaded. For example, the following command reports the checksum of the dotnet-sdk-7.0.304-win-x64.exe file:\\n\\n> certutil -hashfile dotnet-sdk-7.0.304-win-x64.exe SHA512 SHA512 hash of dotnet-sdk-7.0.304-win-x64.exe: 648732c79f6276c37a92e211b4c5b6cf84a0a54637c0f85949ced96d31838b43a4dcae905ef70bafbc9edd3542400746fb1e00c4c84679713e97219493a45938 CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.\\n\\n> (Get-FileHash .\\\\dotnet-sdk-7.0.304-win-x64.exe -Algorithm SHA512).Hash 648732C79F6276C37A92E211B4C5B6CF84A0A54637C0F85949CED96D31838B43A4DCAE905EF70BAFBC9EDD3542400746FB1E00C4C84679713E97219493A45938\\n\\nCompare the checksum with the value provided by the download site.\\n\\nThe .NET release notes contain a link to a checksum file you can use to validate your downloaded file. The following steps describe how to download the checksum file and validate a .NET install binary:\\n\\nThe release notes page for .NET 7 on GitHub at https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/main/release-notes/7.0 contains a section named Releases.

It also serves as a reference document to use with others in the organization as solutions are worked through.\\n\\nStep 2: Obtain stakeholder buy-in\\n\\nPeople are at the heart of nearly every process. Those involved in executing a procedure should be brought in to help improve it. This communicates what’s happening and getting their buy-in at the same time.\\n\\nIn addition, any other stakeholders in the organization should be informed of the process improvement efforts, and their support should be obtained as well. This avoids any potential conflict down the road.\\n\\nDon’t forget to loop in customers, too. If it’s an externally-facing process change, customers must be informed in advance of the change to avoid confusion and a poor user experience when the change arrives.\\n\\nTips for obtaining stakeholder buy-in:\\n\\nGetting people within your organization to support process improvements can be a challenge. Here are tips to overcome this hurdle.\\n\\nExplain the rationale: People are naturally resistant to change, even if it’s for the better.

Moreover, by detailing how the changes will deliver value, such as a better customer experience, stakeholders become motivated to help you.\\n\\nPeople are naturally resistant to change, even if it’s for the better. That’s why you must explain the reasons behind the process improvements to obtain buy-in. Moreover, by detailing how the changes will deliver value, such as a better customer experience, stakeholders become motivated to help you. Clarify roles: Stakeholders hold varying degrees of involvement in process changes. As a result, ensure every stakeholder is clear on their role in the business process improvement plan. For example, some people may be directly involved in executing process changes while others are indirectly affected by it, and hence, do not take an active role in the implementation. So for those directly involved, they must carve out time to help transition to new processes.\\n\\nStep 3: Design the process improvement plan\\n\\nOutlining the process improvements takes place at this stage. Bring together the information gathered in the first step with the stakeholders identified in the second step as taking an active role in the process to form a plan.\\n\\nDetermining the changes required to improve a process isn’t the only component in the plan. You and your team must also decide how you will measure the effectiveness of the changes, evaluate any risks, and identify how the changes will affect the customer experience.\\n\\nOnce all of these elements have been vetted and a course of action determined, any previous process mapping can be revised to lay out the new process, and used as a tool to create training materials.\\n\\nTips for designing the process improvement plan:\\n\\nKeep these tips in mind when outlining the changes required to improve a process.\\n\\nStandardize the process: Ensure your plan objective is to develop a standardized process. A new procedure must create uniformity. Doing so improves both productivity and quality as well as making sure predictable outcomes are achieved. Here, introducing a technical solution to streamline the workflow helps, particularly if the solution automates many of the process steps.\\n\\nCreate a project plan: Transforming processes impacts an organization to varying degrees depending on the extent of the changes. If the process improvement is larger than small adjustments affecting a single team, you may need to perform project planning and build out a full project plan incorporating the five project management process groups. This includes identifying budgets to cover costs like training and any additional resource requirements needed to execute the changes.\\n\\nStep 4: Test the changes\\n\\nIt’s time to evaluate how the new procedure unfolds in real life. Because modifying a process can cause delays or increase costs in the short term while staff get up to speed with the changes, it’s best to test the process improvements with a handful of participants before rolling it out to an entire team or across the organization.\\n\\nTypically, the stakeholders who were actively involved in creating a new procedure would also be the ones testing the changes. Once the tests are completed and results prove the new procedure resolves issues and creates meaningful, measurable improvement, the new process can be implemented across the organization. Depending on the extent of the changes, project integration management may be necessary.\\n\\nTips for testing the changes:\\n\\nWhen it comes to the test phase, follow these suggestions to bring a process change to the point where it’s ready for a full rollout.\\n\\nTake time testing: Be sure your testing is thorough. It should include all common scenarios for the given workflow. Also, use a large enough sample size of test cases to catch issues with the new process. It’s not enough to test a scenario once, so be prepared to run through the changes multiple times to ensure you’re seeing consistent results every time.\\n\\nBe sure your testing is thorough.

It’s not enough to test a scenario once, so be prepared to run through the changes multiple times to ensure you’re seeing consistent results every time. Compile feedback: Collect feedback throughout the testing phase to determine where further improvements can be made. It’s rare to create a flawless new process, so this feedback allows adjustments to happen quickly so that the new process can be fine tuned and ready to roll out to the broader team or to customers.\\n\\nStep 5: Monitor and optimize\\n\\nEven after thorough testing, process improvements require daily monitoring in the early weeks of a rollout to catch any issues that may have been missed during the test phase. Also, it’s an opportunity to see how the new changes can be further enhanced.\\n\\nThe monitoring should compare the results of the improved process against the goals identified at the start of the project. You should also use the outcomes derived under the old procedure as a sounding board to validate the changes are truly an improvement.\\n\\nAs part of the monitoring phase, look for ways to further improve the updated workflow. This optimization means circling back through the process improvement exercise, but additional enhancement opportunities should be fewer than the first round of changes, allowing subsequent iterations to move quickly. Repeat this cycle of continuous optimization until you’ve met or exceeded all benchmarks for the process.\\n\\nTips for monitoring and optimizing:\\n\\nOnce the process improvements are rolled out, your work is not done. Check out these tips to get the most out of the monitoring and optimization phase.\\n\\nCollect more feedback: Continue to collect feedback from stakeholders, especially now that the process changes are live across the organization. You’ll have a broader group of participants to more comprehensively assess how the revised process is working. In addition, be sure to use data analysis in your monitoring and optimization efforts so you can not only review measurable outcomes but also share these results with stakeholders.\\n\\nContinue to collect feedback from stakeholders, especially now that the process changes are live across the organization.

Keep improving: Even after you’ve achieved all objectives for the new process, consider how you can continue to drive your company’s operational excellence further. Like Amazon’s push from two-day delivery to one, look through the lens of the customer experience to identify how you can do more. Here, gap analysis provides an ideal framework for evolving your operations.\\n\\nFinal advice about process improvements\\n\\nOnce you improve processes, the reality is that they must be revisited again in the future. Business goals, market forces, and new technologies evolve, making established procedures inefficient or obsolete.\\n\\nRather than execute a big project whenever a change is required, adopt an approach of small, iterative improvements that happen routinely over time. This continuous improvement cycle is an approach most organizations naturally perform such as when team members make minor procedural adjustments to increase efficiency.\\n\\nThe difference is that you’re implementing a framework that makes process improvement a conscious part of the company’s DNA. That’s when you’re able to deliver operational excellence that keeps evolving to stay ahead of competitors and deliver a superior experience to your customers.', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.8117907047271729, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:2116'})]
Answer: The best way to manage expectations of stakeholders when running a marketing campaign is to engage them in a brainstorming session. This involves utilizing the creative energy and market knowledge of your staff, which helps motivate them and makes them personally invested in the campaign's success. Additionally, obtaining stakeholder buy-in is crucial. This can be achieved by explaining the rationale behind the campaign, detailing how it will deliver value, and clarifying the roles of each stakeholder. This approach ensures that everyone is informed, aligned, and supportive of the campaign's objectives, thereby managing their expectations effectively.

Welcome to the diverse expat club! People from all over the world are discovering that Portugal is a wonderful place to live, and more importantly, it’s welcoming to different cultures and nationalities. But how can a Pakistani move to Portugal?

In this article, we’ll tell you all you need to know to move to Portugal from Pakistan. Dive into the expat life in Portugal, the different Visas and Residence Permits, invest in real estate or businesses, and get some tips to plan your relocation. Good reading!

How to move from Pakistan to Portugal?

In order to move from Pakistan to Portugal, you need to, like any other non-EU citizen, get a Portugal Residence Permit. This can be done by either obtaining a Portugal Residence Visa or directly through an Immigration Services program. Interested? Then keep reading; we’ll explain all about them.

Obtaining a residence permit to live in Portugal from Pakistan

There are different ways to get a residence permit to live in Portugal. You can get a National long-term visa, also known as Residence Visa, suitable for your activity in Portugal. But you can also get a residence permit through the Golden Visa program. Tag along to learn about each of them.

What are the types of Portugal Residence Visa that Pakistani may apply to?

Portugal has many different types of Residence Visas, which non-EU citizens need in order to get into the country to establish residency and be in the country for more than 1 year. The most famous ones are:

D1 Visa: also known as the Work Visa, for people with a work contract in Portugal;

D2 Visa: for those who want to start a business in Portugal;

D4 Visa: known as the Study Visa, for university students;

D7 Visa: for pensioners or passive income earners.

Each Visa type has its own rules, but they usually follow the same process.

With all of these visas, you also get permission to bring your family with you (such as the spouse and children) through a family reunification process.

Once you have the visa, you can enter Portugal and start the process of obtaining your residence permit. After only 5 years of living in Portugal as a regular resident, you have the right to apply for Portuguese nationality.

How can I apply for a Portugal Residence Visa from Pakistan?

Pakistani nationals must lodge the long-term Visa application directly at the Embassy of Portugal in Islamabad.

Each Residence Visa Application is subject to a fee of €90. After submitting all the necessary documents for the visa, your application goes through an evaluation process, which can be accepted or denied by the embassy.

It’s also worth remembering that Pakistani nationals who wish to travel to Portugal for a short period (up to 90 days) do not need a National Residence Visa, but a Schengen visa.

Can a Pakistani apply for a Golden Visa?

Popularly known as the Golden Visa, this program is highly sought after by high-profile investors around the world, and Pakistanis have benefitted from this Visa too.

Starting in 2023, this Visa has gone through much criticism and debate. Thus, policies may change by the time you decide which Visa you’ll apply for. It’s best if you contact a lawyer for important updates regarding the Golden Visa before you start your process.

What do Pakistani need to do to apply for the Portugal Golden Visa?

Officially the Residence Permit for Investment Activity (ARI), the Golden Visa program, benefits foreigners who decide to invest in Portugal. The main benefits of the program are:

Right to live, work, study, and invest in Portugal as a local;

Free movement through the Schengen area countries, without the need for a visa;

After 5 years with the residence permit, you can apply for Portuguese nationality;

Your family members (spouse, children, and dependents) gain the same rights.

But there are rules and a lot of bureaucracy that require a lot of attention and knowledge of Portuguese law. After the changes in 2022, a Pakistani investor must choose one of the following investments to get the Golden Visa:

Acquisition of properties worth more than €500,000 in certain regions of Portugal;

Capital transfer of at least €1.5 million to a Portuguese bank account in your name;

Investment of at least €500,000 in a Portuguese fund;

Creation of at least 10 jobs in a business in Portugal;

Investment in small and medium-sized enterprises of at least €500,000.

Unlike visas, the ARI procedure is not handled by the Portuguese Embassy in Pakistan, but by the Portuguese Immigration Service (SEF).

In addition to showing proof of your investment, you must have opened an account in Portugal, created your Tax Identification Number (NIF), health insurance, and several other essential bureaucratic details.

Due to all these steps to get the Golden Visa and also the high value of the investment, it’s recommended that you have professional support to guide you.

Viv Europe provides assistance services for the Golden Visa and has already helped several Pakistanis move to Portugal. If you have any questions, book a consultation and get the best advice suited for you.

What are the best cities to live in Portugal for Pakistanis?

Portugal is a small but diverse country. From north to south, expats from all over the world find their ideal homes in different locations.

It’s a great idea to visit Portugal before relocating so that you can be sure of where you belong. Going on a scouting trip to Portugal will definitely let you know what the best city in Portugal is for you.

Even though there are several amazing options for places to live in Portugal, expats usually choose the following cities:

Lisbon: the capital and most important city of the Portuguese economy. You can equate the hustle and bustle to that of Karachi in Pakistan;

Porto: Portugal’s 2 nd biggest city, the capital of the northern region;

biggest city, the capital of the northern region; Coimbra: centrally located near the Silver Coast;

Braga: one of the most important cities in the north of Portugal;

Faro: the capital of the southern region of the Algarve;

Lagos: one of the best cities to live in the Algarve region;

Évora: capital of the rural Alentejo region.

As you can see, there are plenty of options to choose from. Some are luxurious and attract the rich and famous, while others are budget-friendly and very typical.

What is the cost of living in Portugal compared to Pakistan?

There is no single answer; after all, the cost of living in Portugal may vary according to your needs, spending habits, and location. However, we can estimate how much an individual would need per month to be able to live well in the country.

Of course, the difference between the cost of living is massive, but so is the quality of life. Take a look at the cost of living estimates:

Expenses Costs A single person’s estimated monthly costs (without rent) €591

(Rs. 181,546) Family of four estimated monthly costs (without rent) €2,058

(Rs. 632,187) Average 1-bedroom residence rent €589

(Rs. 180,932) Average 3-bedroom residence rent €943

(Rs. 289,675)

Estimates are from Numbeo (as of March 2023).

As you can see, Portugal is far more expensive than Pakistan. So you should consider that when considering moving from Pakistan to Portugal. Although, most expats relocating from Pakistan are not in search of a cheaper country but one that can provide a better standard of living.

Numbeo estimates that the cost of living in Pakistan is, on average, 67.6% lower than in Portugal. At the same time, rent in Pakistan is, on average, 87.9% lower than in Portugal.

The good news is that Portugal is known for having one of the lowest living costs in Europe! And, especially considering the fantastic quality of life offered here, the decision to move from Pakistan to Portugal definitely pays off.

What’s the weather like in Portugal?

Portugal, like most countries in Southern Europe, has mild and pleasant temperatures throughout the year. Of course, depending on the region of the country, climates vary, and you may experience extreme weather.

The climates in Portugal are mostly warm and hot-summer Mediterranean, but the Portuguese islands of the Azores have oceanic and humid subtropical climates.

Get to know more about the weather in Portugal in the table below:

Lisbon Porto Algarve Madeira Azores Maximum temperature 27 °C

(80.6 °F) 26 °C

(78.8 °F) 28 °C

(82.4 °F) 24 °C

(75.2 °F) 23 °C

(73.4 °F) Minimum temperature 9 °C

(48.2 °F) 6 °C

(42.8 °F) 11 °C

(51.8 °F) 12 °C

(53.6 °F) 13 °C

(55.4 °F) Average Rainfall 49 mm

(1.9 in) 107 mm

(4.2 in) 41 mm

(1.6 in) 48 mm

(1.8 in) 84 mm

(3.3 in) Average Humidity 74% 76% 69% 74% 78%

The table data was taken from the Climate Data website.

Summers can get really hot, especially in the south of Portugal, while the northern area has much colder and wetter winters.

That said, Pakistan faces extremely high temperatures every year, so Portugal feels like a vacation all year round!

How does the Portuguese economy compare to Pakistan?

After years of the financial crisis after 2008, Portugal has experienced a real economic miracle in the last decade, as covered by the New York Times.

Thanks to tourism and the end of austerity, the country, which was heading toward depression, turned around and rose again. Watch the video below for more details:

Policies such as the Golden Visa and the warm welcome of immigrants have helped the country to revive the economy. Gradually, the country expects to return to a good and stable position for the entire population, and it’s definitely on the right track.

Political and economic instability is not as high as it is in Pakistan. For example, as of February 2023, the inflation rate in Portugal stood at 8.2%, while it was at 31.5% in Pakistan.

What are public facilities like for Pakistani expats?

Portugal is known for its bureaucracy but also for the quality of its public services. Once immigrants, Pakistani or any other nationality, obtain their residence permit, they can enjoy these services like locals.

Healthcare in Portugal

Portugal has a reputable public health system and very low prices, so much so that most Portuguese people choose to use it rather than private healthcare.

When you, as a foreign citizen with a residence permit in Portugal, decide to use the public health system, you must first register. The process is simple, just go to the Health Center closest to your address and make a Número de Utente. Afterward, you can use the National Health System at will.

Simple consultations and exams are fully co-funded by the state, and other exams and emergencies are low-cost.

Tourists also have access to public healthcare in Portugal, but not with the same benefits and low prices that Portuguese nationals and legal residents have.

However, as the public health system can fail or take a long time, especially in Alentejo and Algarve, it may be worth taking out health insurance in Portugal and using the private health system. There are numerous excellent options of private clinics and hospitals throughout the country, and also insurance for every type of need.

How does the educational system work

If you have children and are thinking about moving from Pakistan to Portugal, you will be happy to know that public education in the country is not only free but also of good quality.

Of course, some institutions show better results than others, and there are some downsides to adjusting to the Portuguese national curricula, like having to learn Portuguese to understand lessons.

That’s why it’s also a good idea to consider enrolling your children in international schools in Portugal, where classes may be taught in English, French, or German.

Most expatriate families choose this option because it’s usually easier for their children to fit in with other international children.

If you’re looking for a school, then you should definitely check out our article International Schools In Portugal: Where To Enroll Your Expat Children. We also have articles for specific regions, such as Lisbon and the Algarve.

Where is the Pakistani community in Portugal?

The Pakistani community in Portugal has grown a lot in recent years. According to data from the Office of Strategy and Studies, the Pakistani community is the 20th largest of immigrants in Portugal, increasing since 2012.

The vast majority of Pakistanis in Portugal with a residence permit live in the district of Lisbon, followed by Setúbal and Faro.

In 2021, the large increase in Pakistani and other Asian residents in Odemira, in the south of the country, working in agriculture became mediatic.

Despite having a work contract and a legal work visa in Portugal, the public wondered about the working conditions of these immigrants who, as shown in a DW Documentary, earn only the minimum by law and live in strange conditions.

For immigrants, there remains the benefit of, after 5 years, enjoying their rights and obtaining Portuguese nationality.

What has drawn the most attention, however, is the huge increase in the interest of Pakistani investors and business people in Portugal. As well as business owners of different nationalities, Portugal proves to be a propitious environment to prosper financially with security.

In addition, as you have already seen, the Portuguese government offers several benefits to those who decide to invest in the country.

Adaptation tips for Pakistani immigrants

Portugal is a fantastic country, but it is not Pakistan. I’m sure that even though you are considering moving here, you still love your country deeply. So, as you can imagine, there are quite a few challenges of being an expat in Portugal.

Especially when entire families move abroad, you are going to have to deal with many new experiences and adapt.

To have a good adaptation process, Pakistani families in Portugal should consider:

Learning about the Portuguese culture and respecting the differences;

Being patient with yourselves and with the Portuguese – they don’t know much about Pakistan;

Avoiding comparing Pakistan to Portugal at all times;

Being open-minded to the way Portuguese society works.

Portuguese food is rich and delicious in different ways than Pakistani food. And, although not as warm and loud as the Pakistani, the Portuguese people can also make you feel welcome and part of their family.

Soon, you find out that Portugal and Pakistan have more in common than you would have imagined.

What are the benefits of moving from Pakistan to Portugal?

Moving from Pakistan to Portugal is not a strange thought. Expats from many different nationalities and backgrounds have learned about Portugal’s excellent standard of living and its benefits for new residents.

The Non-Habitual Resident tax regime, for citizens who have not had a tax residence in Portugal for the 5 previous years, it grants you:

10 years of tax benefits;

20% IRS tax rate for internal income;

10% rate on foreign income.

If you have passive income or are a highly qualified professional, you can benefit greatly from this Portugal tax regime. As always, it is recommended to consult a legal professional about your case specifically before applying for the non-habitual resident tax regime.

Short facts about Golden Visas for Portugal

The Golden Visa Program for Portugal provides a series of benefits and it’s already seen as a successful scheme. The Portuguese visa and even citizenship can be gained with the help of specific investments that must be made by those interested. For at least EUR 350,000 as investments in the real estate sector, a foreigner can enter the program for obtaining a visa for Portugal. Such an investment grants the visa for Portugal which also allows the entrance to Schengen countries. One can work and live in Portugal if he or she obtained the golden visa in Portugal. The application for a golden visa for Portugal is quite simple if all the conditions are respected. A clear criminal record, evidence of health insurance, a valid passport, and a negative debt declaration are required for the application for a golden visa in Portugal. All these formalities can be properly handled by one of our immigration agents in Portugal, so feel free to discuss it with our team. One can also ask for more information about the Portuguese residency under this scheme.

The application for permanent residency can be made after living 5 years in Portugal under the temporary status. The next step is to apply for Portugal citizenship and gain a second passport. This is an important document that comes with a series of benefits, like traveling to different countries without restrictions. The freedom of travel is offered by the second passport for Portugal which is considered one of the most important in the world. Please discuss with our immigration lawyers in Portugal for further details.

Healthcare for Portuguese residents

Individuals who are registered residents have access to the Portuguese National Health Service in the same manner as Portuguese citizens. As previously mentioned, registering for healthcare is a mandatory step and this should not be confused with registering with private healthcare – registration with the state service is required. those who have obtained residency can register with the health centre in the area where they live. This is when they will obtain their health number (upon presenting their residence certificate and for employees their social security number).



Healthcare services in Portugal are subject to standard fees, in most cases, this means a fixed amount that depends on the medical services you access. The general practitioner is the one to refer the patient to specialty medical care and the one who will inform individuals of the aforementioned costs (the ones for the medical specialty, in addition to his appointment). Unemployed individuals, children under the age of 12, and pregnant women are not subject to certain fees, treatments, or prescriptions.



Foreign nationals should know that dental care is not habitually covered by the national health service.



Depending on your country of origin, you may be entitled to healthcare funded by your home country. This can apply in the case of UK nationals who have become Portuguese residents and receive a UK State Pension. A special application form is required in this case and it is submitted to the social security system. Some advantages include the fact that the UK national who resides in Portugal can thus gain planned treatments in other EU countries as well as the healthcare cover abroad issued in the UK. If you wish to know your specific rights after Brexit, please reach out to one of our immigration specialists.

Other registrations and requirements for new Portuguese residents

Individuals who move to Portugal and obtain permanent residence here will wish to take care of several other issues, apart from housing, healthcare, and basic services. The list also includes exchanging the driving license issued by the home country with a Portuguese one. This is done with the Institute of Mobility and Transports (Instituto da Mobilidade e de Transportes (IMT) and it depends on the country of origin. Three situations are possible:



The license was issued by an EU/EEA country: the EU license can be used in Portugal until its expiration, however, the Portuguese address where the license holder lives is registered with the IMT within 60 days of settling in the country; a fee of 30 euros applies and the applicant will also need to submit biometric data;

The license was issued by a country with which Portugal has a bilateral agreement: the holder can drive in Portugal for 185 days after his entry in the situation in which he does not intend to settle in the country; upon obtaining residence, he can drive for a period of 90 days after the issuance of the residence document; when the foreign national makes a submission with the IMT two years after taking up residence he/she will need to pass a practical driving test in order to regain the driver’s license.

The license was issued by a country that has signed no international traffic agreements: the holder of such a license cannot drive in the country, meaning that he/she will need to pass a practical examination for each vehicle category; a medical examination is also needed.



The countries with which Portugal has a bilateral agreement for the reciprocal recognition and exchange of driver’s license include Andorra, Angola, Cape-Verde, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Mozambique, Saint Thomas, and Prince (São Tomé and Príncipe), Switzerland, Brazil.

Answer: As a lawyer advising a Pakistani immigrant with a temporary residence permit in France who wishes to move to Portugal, I would guide him through the following steps:

1. **Determine the Type of Visa Needed**: Since the individual is a non-EU citizen, he will need to apply for a Portugal Residence Visa. Depending on his situation, he may choose from several types of visas, such as the D1 Visa (Work Visa), D2 Visa (Entrepreneur Visa), D4 Visa (Study Visa), or D7 Visa (Passive Income Visa).

2. **Apply for a Portugal Residence Visa**: The individual must apply for a long-term residence visa at the Portuguese Embassy or Consulate in France. He will need to submit the necessary documents, including a valid passport, proof of income, proof of accommodation, and a criminal record certificate.

3. **Consider the Golden Visa Option**: If the individual is interested in investing in Portugal, he may consider applying for the Golden Visa, which requires a significant investment in real estate, capital transfer, or business creation in Portugal.

4. **Prepare for the Move**: Once the visa is granted, the individual can move to Portugal. He should ensure that he has health insurance, a Portuguese Tax Identification Number (NIF), and has opened a bank account in Portugal.

5. **Apply for a Residence Permit**: Upon arrival in Portugal, the individual must apply for a residence permit with the Portuguese Immigration Service (SEF). This process involves submitting additional documentation and attending an interview.

6. **Family Reunification**: If the individual wishes to bring his family, he can apply for family reunification, allowing his spouse and children to join him in Portugal.

7. **Learn Portuguese**: It is advisable for the individual to start learning Portuguese, as it will be beneficial for integration and may be required for permanent residency or citizenship applications in the future.

8. **Seek Professional Assistance**: Given the complexity of immigration processes, I would recommend seeking assistance from a legal professional or immigration consultant to ensure compliance with all legal requirements and to facilitate a smooth transition.

By following these steps, the individual can successfully relocate from France to Portugal and begin the process of establishing residency in the new country.

The temporary and permanent residence permits in Portugal are issued by the Portuguese Immigration service for citizens from EU and non-EU countries. Legal assistance should be considered by foreigners in Portugal who can rely on the support of our Portuguese attorneys.\\n\\n\\n\\nStudents and other applicants will need to present additional documents. If you are interested in obtaining residency in Portugal, you can request the special help provided by our immigration team if you have decided to apply for a residence permit.\\n\\nWork permits in Portugal – what you need to know\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-EU citizens need to pay attention to the requirements involving the work permits. Being a country part of the Schengen Area, Portugal solicits a short-term Portuguese Schengen Visa from persons wanting to work no more than three months. Besides that, the Portuguese residence permit needs to be obtained if you intend to work and live in this country. It is important to know that a work permit is issued only for persons who prove they have a job in Portugal by filing different documents from the employer. As it is known, citizens from the EU, EEA, and Switzerland don’t need to consider the issuance of a work permit, but a residence certificate showing they live in this country.

Answer: To advise a Pakistani immigrant with a temporary residence permit in France who wants to move to Portugal, I would recommend the following steps:

1. **Determine the Type of Visa Needed**: Since the individual is a non-EU citizen, they will need to apply for a Portugal Residence Visa. The type of visa will depend on their purpose for moving to Portugal, such as work, study, or investment. Common options include the D1 Visa for work, D2 Visa for business, D4 Visa for study, or D7 Visa for passive income earners.

2. **Apply for a Residence Visa**: The individual should apply for the appropriate Portugal Residence Visa at the Portuguese Embassy or Consulate in France. They will need to submit the necessary documents, which may include a valid passport, proof of means of subsistence, proof of accommodation, and any permit-specific documents like a work contract or proof of investment.

3. **Consider the Golden Visa Program**: If the individual is interested in investing in Portugal, they might consider the Golden Visa program, which requires a significant investment in real estate, capital transfer, or business creation. This program offers benefits such as the right to live, work, and study in Portugal, and free movement within the Schengen area.

4. **Prepare for the Move**: Once the visa is approved, the individual can move to Portugal. They should ensure they have health insurance, a Portuguese Tax Identification Number (NIF), and have registered with the local authorities upon arrival.

5. **Family Reunification**: If the individual has family members they wish to bring to Portugal, they can apply for family reunification once they have their residence permit.

6. **Seek Legal Assistance**: Given the complexities of immigration law, it may be beneficial to consult with an immigration lawyer in Portugal to ensure all legal requirements are met and to assist with the application process.

7. **Plan for Long-term Residency**: After living in Portugal for five years with a temporary residence permit, the individual can apply for permanent residency, provided they meet all the necessary conditions, such as proof of continuous residence and sufficient knowledge of the Portuguese language.

By following these steps, the individual can successfully transition from living in France to establishing residency in Portugal.

Our initial work has focused on micro practices where a few people wear many hats. Although the majority of these practices are less than five years old and have not yet reached financial maturity, they are netting on average $123,000 per physician per year and seeing just 11 patients per day.

For example, nearly 60 percent of their patients agreed with the statements “I receive exactly the care I want and need exactly when and how I want and need it” and “Nothing about my care needs improvement – it is perfect.” In typical practices, only half as many patients agreed with these statements.

For instance, most buyers understand that on-premise licenses are typically purchased with a large, upfront investment and SaaS licenses
Answer: To effectively compare on-premise costs against potential increases in cost with using cloud technology, you need to consider several factors:

1. **Upfront Investment**: On-premise solutions typically require a large upfront investment for licenses, hardware, and infrastructure. In contrast, SaaS solutions usually involve subscription-based pricing with lower initial costs.

2. **Ongoing Costs**: Evaluate the ongoing costs associated with each option. On-premise solutions may incur costs for maintenance, upgrades, and IT staff, while SaaS solutions may have recurring subscription fees.

3. **Scalability**: Consider the scalability of each solution. Cloud-based solutions often offer more flexibility to scale up or down based on business needs, which can impact costs.

4. **IT Management**: Assess the ability to manage IT internally. On-premise solutions may require more in-house IT resources, while SaaS solutions may reduce the need for extensive IT management.

5. **Deployment Speed**: Factor in the speed of deployment. SaaS solutions can often be deployed more quickly than on-premise solutions, potentially leading to faster time-to-value.

6. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: Calculate the TCO for both options over a specific period, considering all associated costs, including initial investments, ongoing expenses, and potential cost savings from efficiencies or reduced IT management.

By analyzing these factors, you can make a more informed comparison of the costs associated with on-premise and cloud-based solutions.

Answer: To effectively compare on-premise costs against potential increases in cost with using cloud technology, you need to consider several factors:

1. **Initial Investment**: On-premise solutions typically require a large upfront investment for licenses, hardware, and infrastructure setup. In contrast, SaaS solutions usually involve a subscription model with lower initial costs.

2. **Operational Costs**: Evaluate ongoing operational costs, including maintenance, upgrades, and IT staff for on-premise systems. SaaS solutions often include these costs in the subscription fee, potentially reducing the need for in-house IT resources.

3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: Consider the scalability of each option. SaaS solutions often offer more flexibility and scalability, allowing businesses to adjust their usage and costs as needed.

4. **Deployment Speed**: SaaS solutions generally offer faster deployment times compared to on-premise systems, which can be a significant factor in cost savings related to time-to-market.

5. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: Calculate the TCO over a specific period, including all direct and indirect costs associated with each option. This includes hardware, software, personnel, and any other related expenses.

6. **Hidden Costs**: Be aware of potential hidden costs, such as data migration, integration with existing systems, and potential downtime during transitions.

Answer: Marketers in the 1970s were more focused on creativity and the concept of marketing genius, as the field was almost purely conceptual with little scientific testing on real data. In contrast, marketers in the 21st century have shifted towards a more analytic approach, with advertising becoming less of an art and more of a science. This change reflects a move from relying on creative intuition to using data-driven methods to understand what works and what doesn't in marketing.

Answer: Marketers in the 1970s were often seen as more creative and genius-like figures, as depicted in shows like "Mad Men." During that time, marketing was largely conceptual, with a focus on creating captivating advertisements without much reliance on scientific testing or real data. However, in the 21st century, marketing has shifted towards a more analytical and data-driven approach. This transition means that while creativity is still important, marketers today rely more on data and scientific methods to understand what works and what doesn't. Therefore, the perception of marketers as purely creative geniuses has evolved to include a strong emphasis on data analysis and scientific rigor.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: The Guide to Patient and Family Engagement in Hospital Quality and Safety focuses on four primary strategies for promoting patient/family engagement in hospital safety and quality of care:

Encourage patients and family members to participate as advisors.

Promote better communication among patients, family members, and health care professionals from the point of admission.

Implement safe continuity of care by keeping the patient and family informed through nurse bedside change-of-shift reports.

Engage patients and families in discharge planning throughout the hospital stay.

As a first step in developing the guide, AHRQ conducted an environmental scan assessing the current literature, tools, and resources available to engage patients and families in their care in the hospital setting. The scan includes:

A framework that describes how patient and family engagement can lead to improved quality and safety.

A description of factors that influence patient and family engagement, including characteristics and perspectives of patients, families, health care professionals, and hospital organizational and cultural factors.

Hospital-based methods and materials currently being used to engage patients and families in the safety and quality of care.

An analysis of what materials are needed but do not currently exist.

Answer: Based on the context provided, here are some strategies you might consider to improve communication and engagement with the family:

1. **Encourage Participation as Advisors**: Invite the parents to participate as advisors in the care process. This can help them feel more involved and valued, potentially increasing their willingness to follow through with recommendations.

2. **Promote Better Communication**: Ensure that communication is clear, open, and ongoing. From the point of admission, make sure that the parents understand the care plan and feel comfortable asking questions or expressing concerns.

3. **Implement Safe Continuity of Care**: Keep the parents informed through regular updates, such as nurse bedside change-of-shift reports. This transparency can help build trust and ensure that they are aware of any changes or important information.

4. **Engage in Discharge Planning**: Involve the parents in discharge planning throughout the hospital stay. This can help them understand the importance of their role in the care process and prepare them for what needs to be done after discharge.

5. **Understand Their Perspectives**: Consider the characteristics and perspectives of the parents. There may be cultural, organizational, or personal factors influencing their actions. Understanding these can help tailor your approach to better meet their needs.

By focusing on these strategies, you may be able to improve engagement and cooperation with the family.

You can’t expect someone to be at their best at such times. But as a manager what can you expect? How can you support the person to take care of themselves emotionally while also making sure they are doing their work (or as much of it as they are able to)?\\n\\nWhat the Experts Say\\n\\nManaging an employee who is going through a stressful period is “one of the real challenges all bosses face,” says Linda Hill, professor at Harvard Business School and author of Being the Boss. Most of us try to keep work and home separate, but “we all have situations in which our personal and professional lives collide,” and how you handle these situations with your employees is often a test of your leadership. You need to be empathetic and compassionate while also being professional and keeping your team productive. It’s a fine line to maintain, says Annie McKee, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education and author of How to Be Happy at Work. Here’s how to manage an employee going through a personal crisis.\\n\\nMake yourself available\\n\\n“People don’t always feel comfortable telling their boss” that a parent is gravely ill or that they feel stressed out in the wake of a crumbling relationship, says McKee. They may be too overwhelmed, or embarrassed that it is causing them to be late repeatedly or to miss deadlines. Often a manager’s first challenge is simply recognizing the warning signs that an employee is going through a difficult time. Invest time in building good relationships with employees so you’ll be able to detect any problems early on. If you maintain an atmosphere of compassion in the office, people are more likely to proactively come to you when they’re going through a tough period.\\n\\nDon’t pry\\n\\nAs a leader, you need to be able to show empathy and care, but you also must avoid becoming an employee’s personal confidante. After all, your job as manager is not to be the office shrink. So don’t ask a bunch of questions about the employee’s problems. As the person with more power in the relationship, the employee may feel compelled to tell you more than they’re comfortable with. “You want to build a caring relationship with employees, not a friendly relationship,” says Hill. Many managers make the mistake of confusing being liked with being trusted or respected. A good manager “has the ability to read and understand other people’s needs and concerns,” says McKee, while still keeping everyone focused on the major task at hand: accomplishing work.\\n\\nListen first, suggest second\\n\\nWhen you speak to an employee about their current struggles, “listen first instead of immediately advocating for some particular course of action,” says Hill. They may just want a sounding board about the difficulties of caring for a sick relative or an opportunity to explain why a divorce has affected their attention span. If you immediately suggest they take a leave of absence or adjust their schedule, they may be put off if that’s not what they were thinking. Instead, ask what both of you can do together to address the issue of performance during the difficult period. “Try to use the word ‘we,’” advises Hill, as in “How can we support you?” The employee may have an idea for a temporary arrangement — some time off, handing off a project to a colleague, or a more flexible schedule for a few weeks — that is amenable to you.\\n\\nKnow what you can offer\\n\\nYou may be more than willing to give a grieving employee several weeks of leave, or to offer a woman with a high-risk pregnancy the ability to work from home. But the decision isn’t always yours to make. “You may be very compassionate but you may be in a company where that’s not the way it works,” says Hill. Of course, if you have the leeway to get creative with a flexible schedule, an adjusted workload, or a temporary work-from-home arrangement, do what you think is best. But also be sure you understand your company’s restrictions on short- and long-term leave, and what, if any, bureaucratic hurdles exist before promising anything to your employee. Explain that you need to check what’s possible before you both commit to an arrangement.\\n\\nIf the employee needs counseling or drug or alcohol services, there may be resources provided by your company’s medical insurance that you can recommend. But investigate the quality of those resources first. “The last thing you want to do is send a suffering employee to avail themselves of a program or supposedly helpful people who then fall short,” says McKee.\\n\\nCheck in regularly to make sure they’re doing ok\\n\\nWhether you’ve settled on a solution yet or not, check in with your employee occasionally by dropping by their desk (keeping their privacy in mind) or sending a brief email. Not only will your employee appreciate that you care, you’ll get a better sense of how they are coping. “You can simply ask, ‘Do you feel like you’ve got a handle on it?,’” says Hill. “And if they do, you can say, ‘Let’s just keep in touch so neither one of us has too many surprises. Or if you get a little over your head, I hope you’ll feel free to come to me and we can do some more problem solving and make further adjustments if necessary.’”\\n\\nConsider workload\\n\\nYou also have to consider whether prolonged absences will adversely affect clients or team members. If so, mitigate those risks by easing the person’s workload. If there are people who are willing and able to take on some of the individual’s projects, you can do that temporarily. Just be sure to reward the people who are stepping in. And then set timelines for any adjustments you make. If the person knows that their situation will last for 6-8 weeks, set a deadline for you to meet and discuss what will happen next. Of course, many situations will be open-ended and in those cases, you can set interim deadlines when you get together to check in on how things are going and make adjustments as necessary. Whatever arrangements you make, be crystal clear about your expectations during this time period. Be realistic about what they can accomplish and set goals they can meet. “For this to be useful,” says McKee, “it’s got to be specific and it has be grounded in reality.”\\n\\nBe transparent and consistent\\n\\nBe conscious of the fact that other employees will take note of how you treat the struggling colleague and will likely expect similar consideration if they too run into difficult times in the future. “If you want to get productive work out of people, they need to trust you and believe that you’ll treat them fairly,” says Hill. Remember that policies may be precedent-setting. Every situation will be unique, but you want to be comfortable with policies in case you are called to apply them again. Keep in mind that solutions could apply to “the next person and the next and the next after that,” says McKee.\\n\\nPrinciples to Remember\\n\\nDo:\\n\\nSet a tone of compassion in the office. It will not only give your employees confidence to approach you with struggles, but also give you the ability to spot warnings signs.\\n\\nBe creative with solutions. A flexible schedule may allow a person to maintain their output without much disruption.\\n\\nCheck in from time to time, both to reassure the employee and to make sure that further adjustments or accommodations aren’t needed.\\n\\nDon’t:\\n\\nAct more like a therapist than a manager. Your heart may be in the right place, but don’t get involved in your employee’s personal problems.\\n\\nMake promises you can’t keep. Research your company’s policies before you offer time off or alternative work arrangements.\\n\\nTreat similar situations among employees differently. Employees will note — and resent — the inconsistency.\\n\\nCase Study #1: Set realistic work goals with the employee and delegate some of their work\\n\\nAlicia Shankland, a senior HR executive with more than 20 years of experience, managed two different women through the intensely stressful, emotional months of fertility treatment.

Answer: When working with a family where the parents aren't following through on your requests, it's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Open Communication**: Initiate a conversation with the parents to understand their perspective. Ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share any challenges or concerns they might be facing.

2. **Listen Actively**: Make sure to listen to their responses without interrupting. This will help you understand their situation better and show that you value their input.

3. **Empathy and Support**: Acknowledge any difficulties they might be experiencing and express your willingness to support them. This can help build trust and encourage cooperation.

4. **Clarify Expectations**: Ensure that your requests are clear and that the parents understand why these actions are important. Sometimes, miscommunication can lead to non-compliance.

5. **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Work together to find solutions that are feasible for the family. This might involve adjusting your expectations or finding alternative ways to achieve the desired outcomes.

6. **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular follow-ups to discuss progress and address any new issues that may arise. This can help maintain momentum and show your ongoing commitment to supporting the family.

7. **Consistency and Fairness**: Be consistent in your approach and ensure that any solutions or accommodations are fair and reasonable.

By approaching the situation with empathy and a collaborative mindset, you can foster a more cooperative relationship with the parents and work towards achieving the desired outcomes together.

Answer: The patient receiving treatment with cisplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab who develops worsening shortness of breath could potentially be experiencing several issues. These could include:

1. **Pneumonitis**: Pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, can cause immune-related adverse events, including pneumonitis. This should be considered, especially if the patient presents with respiratory symptoms.

2. **Pulmonary Embolism**: Cancer patients are at increased risk for thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolism, which could cause shortness of breath.

3. **Cardiotoxicity**: Both cisplatin and paclitaxel have been associated with cardiotoxic effects, which could manifest as heart failure or other cardiac issues leading to shortness of breath.

4. **Infection**: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to chemotherapy, increasing the risk of respiratory infections.

5. **Pleural Effusion**: This could be related to the cancer itself or as a side effect of the treatment.

Initial workup should include:

- **Chest X-ray or CT scan**: To assess for pneumonitis, pleural effusion, or other structural causes of shortness of breath.
- **D-dimer test and possibly a CT pulmonary angiogram**: To evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
- **Echocardiogram**: To assess cardiac function and rule out cardiotoxicity.
- **Complete blood count and blood cultures**: To check for signs of infection.
- **Pulmonary function tests**: If pneumonitis is suspected, these tests can help assess the extent of lung involvement.

These studies will help in identifying the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further management.

Answer: The ethical implications of increased non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) include concerns about routinization and social pressure. Routinization refers to the normalization of NIPT, which can lead to increased pressure on pregnant women to undergo testing and potentially terminate affected pregnancies. This pressure can threaten reproductive freedom by creating indirect social pressure to conform to certain expectations. Additionally, there is a concern that the trivialization of the procedure might reduce the emphasis on careful and comprehensive pretest counseling, leading to information overload and potentially impacting autonomous decision-making. The authors suggest that mindful decision-making and stepwise disclosure should be key educational goals in NIPT counseling to address these ethical concerns.

The most common application of integration is to find the area under the curve on a graph of a function.To work out the integral of more complicated functions than just the known ones, we have some integration rules. These rules can be studied below. Apart from these rules, there are many integral formulas that substitute the integral form.Integration Rules of Basic FunctionsThe integration rules are defined for different types of functions. Let us learn here the basic rules for integration of the some common functions, such as:ConstantVariableSquareReciprocalExponentialTrigonometryIntegration of ConstantIntegration of constant function say ‘a’ will result in:∫a dx = ax + CExample:∫4 dx = 4x + CIntegration of VariableIf x is any variable then;∫x dx = x2/2 + CIntegration of SquareIf the

 Integration RulesIntegrationIntegration can be used to find areas, volumes, central points and many useful things. It is often used to find the area underneath the graph of a function and the x-axis.The first rule to know is that integrals and derivatives are opposites!Sometimes we can work out an integral,because we know a matching derivative.Integration RulesHere are the most useful rules, with examples below:Common Functions Function Integral Constant ∫ a dx ax + C Variable ∫ x dx x2/2 + C Square ∫ x2 dx x3/3 + C Reciprocal ∫ (1/x) dx ln|x| + C Exponential ∫ ex dx ex + C ∫ ax dx ax/ln(a) + C ∫ ln(x) dx x ln(x) − x + C Trigonometry (x in radians) ∫ cos(x) dx sin(x) + C ∫ sin(x) dx -cos(x) + C ∫ sec2(x) dx tan(x) + C Rules FunctionIntegralMultiplication by constant ∫ cf(x) dx c ∫ f(x) dx Power Rule (n≠−1) ∫ xn dx xn+1n+1 + C Sum Rule ∫ (f + g) dx ∫ f dx + ∫ g dx Difference Rule ∫ (f - g) dx ∫ f dx - ∫ g dx Integration by Parts See Integration by Parts
Answer: The rules needed for integration include:

1. Integration of Common Functions:
   - Constant: ∫a dx = ax + C
   - Variable: ∫x dx = x²/2 + C
   - Square: ∫x² dx = x³/3 + C
   - Reciprocal: ∫(1/x) dx = ln|x| + C
   - Exponential: ∫e^x dx = e^x + C, ∫a^x dx = a^x/ln(a) + C
   - Logarithmic: ∫ln(x) dx = x ln(x) − x + C
   - Trigonometric (x in radians): ∫cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C, ∫sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C, ∫sec²(x) dx = tan(x) + C

2. Integration Rules:
   - Multiplication by a constant: ∫cf(x) dx = c ∫f(x) dx
   - Power Rule (n≠−1): ∫x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C
   - Sum Rule: ∫(f + g) dx = ∫f dx + ∫g dx
   - Difference Rule: ∫(f - g) dx = ∫f dx - ∫g dx

This communicates what’s happening and getting their buy-in at the same time.\\n\\nIn addition, any other stakeholders in the organization should be informed of the process improvement efforts, and their support should be obtained as well. This avoids any potential conflict down the road.\\n\\nDon’t forget to loop in customers, too. If it’s an externally-facing process change, customers must be informed in advance of the change to avoid confusion and a poor user experience when the change arrives.\\n\\nTips for obtaining stakeholder buy-in:\\n\\nGetting people within your organization to support process improvements can be a challenge. Here are tips to overcome this hurdle.\\n\\nExplain the rationale: People are naturally resistant to change, even if it’s for the better. That’s why you must explain the reasons behind the process improvements to obtain buy-in. Moreover, by detailing how the changes will deliver value, such as a better customer experience, stakeholders become motivated to help you.\\n\\nPeople are naturally resistant to change, even if it’s for the better. That’s why you must explain the reasons behind the process improvements to obtain buy-in. Moreover, by detailing how the changes will deliver value, such as a better customer experience, stakeholders become motivated to help you. Clarify roles: Stakeholders hold varying degrees of involvement in process changes. As a result, ensure every stakeholder is clear on their role in the business process improvement plan. For example, some people may be directly involved in executing process changes while others are indirectly affected by it, and hence, do not take an active role in the implementation. So for those directly involved, they must carve out time to help transition to new processes.\\n\\nStep 3: Design the process improvement plan\\n\\nOutlining the process improvements takes place at this stage. Bring together the information gathered in the first step with the stakeholders identified in the second step as taking an active role in the process to form a plan.\\n\\nDetermining the changes required to improve a process isn’t the only component in the plan. You and your team must also decide how you will measure the effectiveness of the changes, evaluate any risks, and identify how the changes will affect the customer experience.\\n\\nOnce all of these elements have been vetted and a course of action determined, any previous process mapping can be revised to lay out the new process, and used as a tool to create training materials.\\n\\nTips for designing the process improvement plan:\\n\\nKeep these tips in mind when outlining the changes required to improve a process.\\n\\nStandardize the process: Ensure your plan objective is to develop a standardized process. A new procedure must create uniformity. Doing so improves both productivity and quality as well as making sure predictable outcomes are achieved. Here, introducing a technical solution to streamline the workflow helps, particularly if the solution automates many of the process steps.\\n\\nCreate a project plan: Transforming processes impacts an organization to varying degrees depending on the extent of the changes. If the process improvement is larger than small adjustments affecting a single team, you may need to perform project planning and build out a full project plan incorporating the five project management process groups. This includes identifying budgets to cover costs like training and any additional resource requirements needed to execute the changes.\\n\\nStep 4: Test the changes\\n\\nIt’s time to evaluate how the new procedure unfolds in real life. Because modifying a process can cause delays or increase costs in the short term while staff get up to speed with the changes, it’s best to test the process improvements with a handful of participants before rolling it out to an entire team or across the organization.\\n\\nTypically, the stakeholders who were actively involved in creating a new procedure would also be the ones testing the changes. Once the tests are completed and results prove the new procedure resolves issues and creates meaningful, measurable improvement, the new process can be implemented across the organization. Depending on the extent of the changes, project integration management may be necessary.\\n\\nTips for testing the changes:\\n\\nWhen it comes to the test phase, follow these suggestions to bring a process change to the point where it’s ready for a full rollout.\\n\\nTake time testing: Be sure your testing is thorough. It should include all common scenarios for the given workflow. Also, use a large enough sample size of test cases to catch issues with the new process. It’s not enough to test a scenario once, so be prepared to run through the changes multiple times to ensure you’re seeing consistent results every time.\\n\\nBe sure your testing is thorough. It should include all common scenarios for the given workflow. Also, use a large enough sample size of test cases to catch issues with the new process. It’s not enough to test a scenario once, so be prepared to run through the changes multiple times to ensure you’re seeing consistent results every time. Compile feedback: Collect feedback throughout the testing phase to determine where further improvements can be made. It’s rare to create a flawless new process, so this feedback allows adjustments to happen quickly so that the new process can be fine tuned and ready to roll out to the broader team or to customers.\\n\\nStep 5: Monitor and optimize\\n\\nEven after thorough testing, process improvements require daily monitoring in the early weeks of a rollout to catch any issues that may have been missed during the test phase. Also, it’s an opportunity to see how the new changes can be further enhanced.\\n\\nThe monitoring should compare the results of the improved process against the goals identified at the start of the project. You should also use the outcomes derived under the old procedure as a sounding board to validate the changes are truly an improvement.\\n\\nAs part of the monitoring phase, look for ways to further improve the updated workflow. This optimization means circling back through the process improvement exercise, but additional enhancement opportunities should be fewer than the first round of changes, allowing subsequent iterations to move quickly. Repeat this cycle of continuous optimization until you’ve met or exceeded all benchmarks for the process.\\n\\nTips for monitoring and optimizing:\\n\\nOnce the process improvements are rolled out, your work is not done. Check out these tips to get the most out of the monitoring and optimization phase.\\n\\nCollect more feedback: Continue to collect feedback from stakeholders, especially now that the process changes are live across the organization. You’ll have a broader group of participants to more comprehensively assess how the revised process is working. In addition, be sure to use data analysis in your monitoring and optimization efforts so you can not only review measurable outcomes but also share these results with stakeholders.\\n\\nContinue to collect feedback from stakeholders, especially now that the process changes are live across the organization. You’ll have a broader group of participants to more comprehensively assess how the revised process is working. In addition, be sure to use data analysis in your monitoring and optimization efforts so you can not only review measurable outcomes but also share these results with stakeholders. Keep improving: Even after you’ve achieved all objectives for the new process, consider how you can continue to drive your company’s operational excellence further. Like Amazon’s push from two-day delivery to one, look through the lens of the customer experience to identify how you can do more. Here, gap analysis provides an ideal framework for evolving your operations.\\n\\nFinal advice about process improvements\\n\\nOnce you improve processes, the reality is that they must be revisited again in the future. Business goals, market forces, and new technologies evolve, making established procedures inefficient or obsolete.\\n\\nRather than execute a big project whenever a change is required, adopt an approach of small, iterative improvements that happen routinely over time. This continuous improvement cycle is an approach most organizations naturally perform such as when team members make minor procedural adjustments to increase efficiency.\\n\\nThe difference is that you’re implementing a framework that makes process improvement a conscious part of the company’s DNA. That’s when you’re able to deliver operational excellence that keeps evolving to stay ahead of competitors and deliver a superior experience to your customers.', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.7554545402526855, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:2116'})]
Answer: The context provided does not directly address rules for integration.

Answer: For a patient with Ewing sarcoma of the femur who is due for restaging scans while on VDC/IE after undergoing surgery with hardware placement, the clinician should consider ordering a PET/CT scan. The context suggests that PET/CT is commonly used for restaging in cases of suspected local disease relapse, early post-surgical staging, characterization of suspected lung nodules, and suspected metastases in other sites. 

Patient factors that may influence the clinician's decision include:

1. **Suspected Local Disease Relapse**: If there is suspicion of local recurrence, PET/CT can be useful in detecting viable tumor tissue.

2. **Post-Surgical Staging**: Since the patient has undergone surgery, PET/CT can help in early post-surgical staging, especially if there is a high risk of relapse or if further surgical intervention is planned.

3. **Presence of Hardware**: The presence of hardware may affect the choice of imaging modality. MRI might be less preferred due to potential artifacts from the metal hardware, making PET/CT a more suitable option.

4. **Suspected Metastases**: If there is suspicion of metastases, particularly in the lungs or other sites, PET/CT can provide comprehensive information.

5. **Overall Treatment Response**: PET/CT can assess the response to ongoing chemotherapy (VDC/IE) by evaluating metabolic activity in the tumor and any metastatic sites.

In summary, a PET/CT scan is recommended for restaging in this scenario, considering the factors mentioned above.

Combinational Logic Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you though setting up a simple combinational logic system made of two gates, an AND gate and an XOR gate. The inputs will be driven from switches that you can flip around while the simulation is running, and the outputs will be visible with a Scope block (which simulates an oscilloscope display). I'm assuming that you've extracted the library and added it to the Matlab path; if not, go here first.

You might want to print this page out to make it easier to refer to while you follow along; if you are on a machine with dual monitors like the ELE lab machines you can also move this window onto the smaller screen and leave the bigger one free for running Simulink. Simulink tends to be a space hog in terms of screen real estate; you end up opening many windows while working, so dual headed systems are a welcome improvement.

Now you are ready to start placing blocks into the model. You do this in Simulink by dragging and dropping the
Answer: To design a circuit using simple Simulink logic gates, follow these steps:

1. Open Simulink and create a blank model.
2. Access the Simulink library to select the necessary blocks.
3. For an OR gate example, you will need:
   - Two constant blocks to serve as inputs.
   - A logic operator block to perform the OR operation.
   - A display block to show the output.
4. Drag the required blocks from the commonly used blocks library into your model, or type the block names directly into your model to select them.
5. Arrange the blocks in your model as needed.
6. Right-click on the logic operator block to access and configure the block parameters. You can choose from various logic gates like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, NXOR, and NOT.
7. Connect the blocks appropriately to form the desired logic circuit.
8. Run the simulation to test the circuit and view the output on the display block.

This process allows you to build and simulate logic gate circuits in Simulink.

Answer: To design a circuit using simple Simulink logic gates, follow these steps:

1. **Open Simulink**: Start by opening Simulink and creating a blank model.

2. **Access the Simulink Library**: Click on the blank model and select the Simulink library.

3. **Select Blocks**: Choose the blocks you need for your logic gate circuit. For example, to build an OR gate, you will need:
   - Two constant blocks to act as inputs.
   - A logic operator block to perform the OR operation.
   - A display block to show the output.

4. **Add Blocks to Model**: Drag the selected blocks into your model. Alternatively, you can type the name of the block in your model and select it.

5. **Configure Logic Operator**: Right-click on the logic operator block to display its parameters. You can configure it to use different gates like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, NXOR, and NOT.

6. **Connect Blocks**: Connect the constant blocks to the inputs of the logic operator block, and connect the output of the logic operator to the display block.

7. **Run the Simulation**: Once your blocks are connected, you can run the simulation to see the output of your logic gate circuit.

This process allows you to create and simulate simple logic gate circuits using Simulink.

RAG Score: 79
GraphRAG Score: 79Question: What should be the frequency of psychotherapy?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: 







The initial stages of your therapy journey can be full of questions, and many times, the most common questions involve the frequency and effectiveness of the therapy sessions themselves. When starting anything, it's natural to want to know what to expect in terms of results. How many sessions before we see the outcome that we want? And what do we have to do to get it? Many clients ask the same questions and much of this is answered by taking a look at how often you see your therapist.





The general rule of thumb for the frequency of therapy sessions is once per week, especially in the beginning. Therapy requires a concentrated effort on a consistent basis to realize the fullest benefits from the therapeutic relationship - in other words, it takes work to get good results. If that's not possible, many therapists will advise no less than twice monthly sessions. Once-monthly therapy sessions tend to hinder a client’s progress and prolong the length of time spent in therapy - it’s simply not enough time and not often enough support to develop significant change.





How long do I have to go to therapy for?

As for how long you may want to continue therapy sessions for, that typically relies on several factors and will vary from person to person. For example, someone that needs support during a big transition may require a different number of sessions as someone dealing with anxiety, depression or trauma.





Your therapist will assess your mental health issues, and together you’ll arrive at a plan of treatment and goals for your therapy outcome. Why you started therapy, how long you struggled with a particular set of issues or feelings, how much they are impacting your day-to-day life, and how motivated you are to resolve them are all components that influence the appropriate number of therapy sessions. Cost, schedule, availability and transportation can all be important factors as well, and should be considered in advance as you work out your overall ability to commit to your therapeutic process. To that end, it’s important to be upfront about how many therapy sessions you can realistically attend on a monthly basis and talk to your therapist about it during the first appointment.





Session frequency also plays a big part in determining the length of therapy. Patients that are able to fit in one session a week with their therapist in their schedule may not need to see a therapist for as long, because it makes therapy that much more effective.





While once weekly sessions are generally the best, your therapist may determine that you could still benefit from less frequent sessions, and biweekly sessions makes sense, or if you require more frequent sessions.





When will I see results from therapy?





When thinking about success rates, there are two important stages to consider: “reliable improvement” and “full recovery,” each one with their own general timeline. While multiple sessions are definitely required, reliable improvement - meaning noticeable positive effects - has been found to be achieved in a relatively short amount of time. According to research, quite a few clients (about 30%), may only need three or so therapy sessions to achieve very worthwhile benefits to their mental health. About 50% are likely to have achieved worthwhile benefit after eight therapy sessions and approximately 75% after fourteen. Full recovery, then, further depends on the depth and nature of your particular situation and varies pretty widely. Weekly therapy can generally help speed up your recovery as the things you discuss during your weekly session with your therapist stay top of mind as you go about your daily life.

As in most areas of our lives, commitment and hard work make a big difference. With cognitive and behavioral therapies, clients who actively work on relevant challenges or homework between therapy sessions, especially in weekly sessions, add considerably to the effectiveness of therapy. Regardless of therapy model, the more you apply yourself to the process, the faster you’ll start to see benefits in your mental health and treatment outcomes.





In conclusion

As far as journeys go, your therapy sessions offer a pathway to better mental health, more refined coping mechanisms and skills, improved sleep - the list goes on and on. Working closely with a trusted therapist that is a good fit for you in weekly sessions can bring out noticeable improvements rather quickly when you consider how long you may have been living without therapy and trying to handle everything yourself. Since we are often biased, bringing a neutral party such as a therapist onto your team and following their lead is a great way to bring about meaningful change - you’ll see that a weekly commitment to therapy is well worth the time and effort.

Looking for a therapist?

At reflect, we feel strongly about the benefits of weekly therapy for treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, for many people, it is hard to find a therapist that is available for weekly sessions, especially if you go through insurance, because therapists that take insurance often have limited availability and long waitlists. That's why we match you with therapists that have no waitlists and are able to give you the support you need. We also provide free intro calls with our therapists, so that you can talk to them about your schedule, and get a feel for if they would be a good fit for you. More importantly, we will ensure that you are supported during the entire therapy process.

Overview

Psychotherapy is an approach for treating mental health issues by talking with a psychologist, psychiatrist or another mental health provider. It also is known as talk therapy, counseling, psychosocial therapy or, simply, therapy.

During psychotherapy, you learn about your specific issues and how your thoughts, emotions and behaviors affect your moods. Talk therapy helps you learn how to take control of your life and respond to challenging situations with healthy coping skills.

There are many types of psychotherapy. The type that's right for you depends on your situation.

Why it's done

Psychotherapy can help treat most mental health issues, including:

Anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), phobias, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

such as social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), phobias, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mood disorders, such as depression or bipolar disorder.

such as anorexia or bulimia. Personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder or dependent personality disorder.

such as borderline personality disorder or dependent personality disorder. Schizophrenia or other disorders that cause detachment from reality.

Not everyone who benefits from psychotherapy is diagnosed with a mental illness. Psychotherapy can help with the stresses and conflicts of life that can affect anyone.

For example, psychotherapy may help you:

Resolve conflicts with your partner or someone else in your life.

with your partner or someone else in your life. Relieve anxiety or stress due to work or other situations.

due to work or other situations. Cope with major life changes, such as divorce, the death of a loved one or the loss of a job.

such as divorce, the death of a loved one or the loss of a job. Learn to manage unhealthy reactions, such as road rage or other aggressive behavior.

such as road rage or other aggressive behavior. Come to terms with an ongoing or serious health issue, such as diabetes, cancer or long-term pain.

such as diabetes, cancer or long-term pain. Recover from physical or sexual abuse or witnessing violence.

or witnessing violence. Cope with sexual problems, whether they're due to a physical or psychological cause.

whether they're due to a physical or psychological cause. Sleep better if you have trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep.

In some cases, psychotherapy can be as effective as medicines, such as antidepressants. But depending on your situation, talk therapy alone may not be enough to ease the symptoms of a mental health condition. You also may need medicines or other treatments.

Risks

Psychotherapy generally involves little risk. But because it can explore painful feelings and experiences, you may feel emotionally uncomfortable at times. A skilled therapist who can meet your needs can minimize any risks.

Learning coping skills can help you manage and conquer negative feelings and fears.

How you prepare

Here's how to get started:

Find a qualified mental health therapist. Get a referral from a health care provider, health insurance plan, friend or another trusted source. Many employers offer counseling services or referrals through employee assistance programs, also known as EAPs. Or you can find a therapist on your own. You could start by looking for a professional association on the internet. Look for a therapist who has skills and training in the area that you need help addressing.

You could start by looking for a professional association on the internet. Look for a therapist who has skills and training in the area that you need help addressing. Understand the costs. If you have health insurance, find out what coverage is available for psychotherapy. Some health plans cover only a certain number of psychotherapy sessions a year. Also, talk to your therapist about fees and payment options.

If you have health insurance, find out what coverage is available for psychotherapy. Some health plans cover only a certain number of psychotherapy sessions a year. Also, talk to your therapist about fees and payment options. Review your concerns. Before your first appointment, think about what issues you'd like to work on. You also can sort this out with your therapist but having some sense in advance may provide a good starting point.

Check qualifications

Before seeing a psychotherapist, check the person's background, education, certification, and licensing. Psychotherapist is a general term rather than a job title or an indication of education, training or licensure.

Trained psychotherapists may have different job titles, depending on their education and role. Most have a master's or doctoral degree with training in psychological counseling. Medical doctors specializing in mental health are known as psychiatrists. They can prescribe medicines, and some may provide psychotherapy.

Examples of psychotherapists include:

Psychologists.

Psychiatrists.

Licensed professional counselors.

Licensed social workers.

Licensed marriage and family therapists.

Psychiatric nurses.

Other licensed professionals with mental health training.

Make sure that the therapist you choose meets state certification and licensing requirements. The key is to find a skilled therapist who can match the type and intensity of therapy with your needs.

What you can expect

Your first therapy session

At the first psychotherapy session, the therapist usually gathers information about you and your needs. You may be asked to fill out forms about your physical and emotional health. It might take a few sessions for your therapist to fully understand your situation and concerns and determine the best course of action.

The first session is also an opportunity for you to interview your therapist. You'll be able to see whether the therapist's approach and personality are going to work for you. Make sure you understand:

What type of therapy will be used.

The goals of your treatment.

How long each session will be.

How many therapy sessions you may need.

Ask questions anytime during your appointment. If you don't feel comfortable with the first therapist you see, try someone else. Having a good fit with your therapist is critical for effective treatment.

Starting psychotherapy

You'll likely meet your therapist weekly or every other week for 45 minutes to one hour. These sessions could be held in the therapist's office, or you could meet during a video visit. Psychotherapy also can take place in a hospital if you've been admitted for treatment. In the hospital, psychotherapy focuses on safety and becoming more mentally and emotionally stable.

Types of psychotherapy

Some types of psychotherapy work better than others in treating certain disorders and conditions. Your therapist will consider your situation and preferences to determine which approach or combination of approaches is best for you.

Some psychotherapy methods proven effective include:

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps you identify unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and learn healthier coping skills.

which helps you identify unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and learn healthier coping skills. Dialectical behavior therapy, a type of CBT that teaches behavioral skills to help you handle stress, manage your emotions and improve your relationships with others.

which helps you become aware of and accept your thoughts and feelings. It also helps you commit to making changes and improves your ability to cope with, and adjust to, challenging situations. Psychodynamic and psychoanalysis therapies, which focus on increasing your awareness of thoughts and behaviors that you may not be aware of. These therapies help you find out what motivates you and help you resolve conflicts.

which focus on increasing your awareness of thoughts and behaviors that you may not be aware of. These therapies help you find out what motivates you and help you resolve conflicts. Interpersonal psychotherapy, which focuses on problems with your relationships with other people to improve how you relate to others, such as family, friends and co-workers.

which focuses on problems with your relationships with other people to improve how you relate to others, such as family, friends and co-workers. Supportive psychotherapy, which improves your ability to cope with stress and difficult situations.

Online apps are available that use several methods.

Psychotherapy formats include individual, couple, family or group sessions. These formats can be effective for all age groups.

During psychotherapy

For most types of psychotherapy, your therapist encourages you to talk about your thoughts and feelings and what's troubling you. Don't worry if you find it hard to open up about your feelings. Your therapist can help you gain more confidence and comfort as time goes on.

Because psychotherapy sometimes involves intense emotional discussions, you may find yourself crying, becoming upset or even having an angry outburst during a session. You also may feel physically exhausted after a session. Your therapist can help you cope with these feelings and emotions.

After a session, your therapist may ask you to do specific activities or practice what you learned. Over time, discussing your concerns can improve your mood and change the way you think and feel about yourself. It also can improve your ability to cope with problems.

Confidentiality

Except in rare cases, conversations with your therapist are confidential. But a therapist may break confidentiality if there's an immediate threat to safety or when state or federal law requires reporting concerns to authorities. Your therapist can answer questions about confidentiality.

Length of psychotherapy

The number of psychotherapy sessions you need and how frequently you need to see your therapist depends on factors such as:

Your mental health issues.

Severity of your symptoms.

How long you've had symptoms or have been dealing with your mental health issues.

How quickly you make progress toward your treatment goals.

How much stress you're experiencing.

How much your mental health concerns interfere with daily life.

How much support you receive from family members and others.

Cost and insurance limitations.

The length of psychotherapy sessions also can depend on the method used. For example, cognitive behavioral therapy consists of a shorter course of treatment. But dialectical behavior therapy can take longer. Your therapist can help you understand how long treatment will take.

It may take only weeks to help you cope with a short-term issue. Or treatment may last a year or longer if you have a long-term mental health issue or other long-term concerns.

Results

Psychotherapy may not cure your condition or make an unpleasant situation go away. But it can give you the power to cope in a healthy way and feel better about yourself and your life.

Getting the most out of psychotherapy

To get the most out of psychotherapy, take these steps:

Make sure you feel comfortable with your therapist. If you aren't comfortable, look for another therapist who can make you feel more at ease.

If you aren't comfortable, look for another therapist who can make you feel more at ease. Approach therapy as a partnership. Psychotherapy is most effective when you actively participate and share in decision-making. Make sure you and your therapist agree about the major issues and how to work on them. Together, you can set goals and measure progress over time.

Answer: The general rule of thumb for the frequency of psychotherapy sessions is once per week, especially in the beginning. If weekly sessions are not possible, many therapists advise no less than twice monthly sessions. Once-monthly therapy sessions tend to hinder a client’s progress and prolong the length of time spent in therapy.
RAG Score: 79
GraphRAG Score: 79Question: The distribution of burials in a parish register during a plague outbreak shows a decline in child burials compared to the usual figure. What are the possible reasons for this?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: In early April, writer Jen Miller urged New York Times readers to start a coronavirus diary.

“Who knows,” she wrote, “maybe one day your diary will provide a valuable window into this period.”

During a different pandemic, one 17th-century British naval administrator named Samuel Pepys did just that. He fastidiously kept a diary from 1660 to 1669 – a period of time that included a severe outbreak of the bubonic plague in London. Epidemics have always haunted humans, but rarely do we get such a detailed glimpse into one person’s life during a crisis from so long ago.

There were no Zoom meetings, drive-through testing or ventilators in 17th-century London. But Pepys’ diary reveals that there were some striking resemblances in how people responded to the pandemic.

A creeping sense of crisis

For Pepys and the inhabitants of London, there was no way of knowing whether an outbreak of the plague that occurred in the parish of St. Giles, a poor area outside the city walls, in late 1664 and early 1665 would become an epidemic.

The plague first entered Pepys’ consciousness enough to warrant a diary entry on April 30, 1665: “Great fears of the Sickenesse here in the City,” he wrote, “it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve us all.”

Pepys continued to live his life normally until the beginning of June, when, for the first time, he saw houses “shut up” – the term his contemporaries used for quarantine – with his own eyes, “marked with a red cross upon the doors, and ‘Lord have mercy upon us’ writ there.” After this, Pepys became increasingly troubled by the outbreak.

He soon observed corpses being taken to their burial in the streets, and a number of his acquaintances died, including his own physician.

By mid-August, he had drawn up his will, writing, “that I shall be in much better state of soul, I hope, if it should please the Lord to call me away this sickly time.” Later that month, he wrote of deserted streets; the pedestrians he encountered were “walking like people that had taken leave of the world.”

Tracking mortality counts

In London, the Company of Parish Clerks printed “bills of mortality,” the weekly tallies of burials.

Because these lists noted London’s burials – not deaths – they undoubtedly undercounted the dead. Just as we follow these numbers closely today, Pepys documented the growing number of plague victims in his diary.

At the end of August, he cited the bill of mortality as having recorded 6,102 victims of the plague, but feared “that the true number of the dead this week is near 10,000,” mostly because the victims among the urban poor weren’t counted. A week later, he noted the official number of 6,978 in one week, “a most dreadfull Number.”

By mid-September, all attempts to control the plague were failing. Quarantines were not being enforced, and people gathered in places like the Royal Exchange. Social distancing, in short, was not happening.

He was equally alarmed by people attending funerals in spite of official orders. Although plague victims were supposed to be interred at night, this system broke down as well, and Pepys griped that burials were taking place “in broad daylight.”

Desperate for remedies

There are few known effective treatment options for COVID-19. Medical and scientific research need time, but people hit hard by the virus are willing to try anything. Fraudulent treatments, from teas and colloidal silver, to cognac and cow urine, have been floated.

Although Pepys lived during the Scientific Revolution, nobody in the 17th century knew that the Yersinia pestis bacterium carried by fleas caused the plague. Instead, the era’s scientists theorized that the plague was spreading through miasma, or “bad air” created by rotting organic matter and identifiable by its foul smell. Some of the most popular measures to combat the plague involved purifying the air by smoking tobacco or by holding herbs and spices in front of one’s nose.

Tobacco was the first remedy that Pepys sought during the plague outbreak. In early June, seeing shut-up houses “put me into an ill conception of myself and my smell, so that I was forced to buy some roll-tobacco to smell … and chaw.” Later, in July, a noble patroness gave him “a bottle of plague-water” – a medicine made from various herbs. But he wasn’t sure whether any of this was effective. Having participated in a coffeehouse discussion about “the plague growing upon us in this town and remedies against it,” he could only conclude that “some saying one thing, some another.”

During the outbreak, Pepys was also very concerned with his frame of mind; he constantly mentioned that he was trying to be in good spirits. This was not only an attempt to “not let it get to him” – as we might say today – but also informed by the medical theory of the era, which claimed that an imbalance of the so-called humors in the body – blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm – led to disease.

Melancholy – which, according to doctors, resulted from an excess of black bile – could be dangerous to one’s health, so Pepys sought to suppress negative emotions; on Sept. 14, for example, he wrote that hearing about dead friends and acquaintances “doth put me into great apprehensions of melancholy. … But I put off the thoughts of sadness as much as I can.”

Balancing paranoia and risk

Humans are social animals and thrive on interaction, so it’s no surprise that so many have found social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic challenging. It can require constant risk assessment: How close is too close? How can we avoid infection and keep our loved ones safe, while also staying sane? What should we do when someone in our house develops a cough?

During the plague, this sort of paranoia also abounded. Pepys found that when he left London and entered other towns, the townspeople became visibly nervous about visitors.

“They are afeared of us that come to them,” he wrote in mid-July, “insomuch that I am troubled at it.”

Pepys succumbed to paranoia himself: In late July, his servant Will suddenly developed a headache. Fearing that his entire house would be shut up if a servant came down with the plague, Pepys mobilized all his other servants to get Will out of the house as quickly as possible. It turned out that Will didn’t have the plague, and he returned the next day.

In early September, Pepys refrained from wearing a wig he bought in an area of London that was a hotspot of the disease, and he wondered whether other people would also fear wearing wigs because they could potentially be made of the hair of plague victims.

And yet he was willing to risk his health to meet certain needs; by early October, he visited his mistress without any regard for the danger: “round about and next door on every side is the plague, but I did not value it but there did what I could con ella.”

Just as people around the world eagerly wait for a falling death toll as a sign of the pandemic letting up, so did Pepys derive hope – and perhaps the impetus to see his mistress – from the first decline in deaths in mid-September. A week later, he noted a substantial decline of more than 1,800.

Let’s hope that, like Pepys, we’ll soon see some light at the end of the tunnel.

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals through fleas. Humans can be infected through:

the bite of infected vector fleas

unprotected contact with infectious bodily fluids or contaminated materials

the inhalation of respiratory droplets/small particles from a patient with pneumonic plague.

Plague is a very severe disease in people, particularly in its septicaemic (systemic infection caused by circulating bacteria in bloodstream) and pneumonic forms, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 100% if left untreated. The pneumonic form is invariably fatal unless treated early. It is especially contagious and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air.

Historically, plague was responsible for widespread pandemics with high mortality. It was known as the "Black Death" during the fourteenth century, causing more than 50 million deaths in Europe. Nowadays, plague is easily treated with antibiotics and the use of standard precautions to prevent acquiring infection.

Signs and symptoms

People infected with plague usually develop acute febrile disease with other non-specific systemic symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days, such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, and weakness, vomiting and nausea.

There are two main forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic.

Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, Y. pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a ‘bubo’. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with pus. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare. Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more severe type of plague called pneumonic plague.

Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare. Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more severe type of plague called pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague, or lung-based plague, is the most virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated early, can be fatal. However, recovery rates are high if detected and treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms).

Where is plague found?

As an animal disease, plague is found in all continents, except Oceania. There is a risk of human plague wherever the presence of plague natural foci (the bacteria, an animal reservoir and a vector) and human population co-exist.

Plague epidemics have occurred in Africa, Asia, and South America; but since the 1990s, most human cases have occurred in Africa. The three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. In Madagascar cases of bubonic plague are reported nearly every year, during the epidemic season (between September and April).

Diagnosing plague

Confirmation of plague requires lab testing. The best practice is to identify Y. pestis from a sample of pus from a bubo, blood or sputum. A specific Y. pestis antigen can be detected by different techniques. One of them is a laboratory validated rapid dipstick test now widely used in Africa and South America, with the support of WHO.

Treatment

Untreated pneumonic plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and reduction of complications. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time. Pneumonic plague can be fatal within 18 to 24 hours of disease onset if left untreated, but common antibiotics for enterobacteria (gram negative rods) can effectively cure the disease if they are delivered early.

Prevention

Preventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. Generally people should be advised to avoid direct contact with infected body fluids and tissues. When handling potentially infected patients and collecting specimens, standard precautions should apply.

Vaccination

WHO does not recommend vaccination, expect for high-risk groups (such as laboratory personnel who are constantly exposed to the risk of contamination, and health care workers).

Managing plague outbreaks

Find and stop the source of infection. Identify the most likely source of infection in the area where the human case(s) was exposed, typically looking for clustered areas with large numbers of small animal deaths. Institute appropriate infection, prevention and control procedures. Institute vector control, then rodent control. Killing rodents before vectors will cause the fleas to jump to new hosts, this is to be avoided.

Routine hand-washing is recommended with soap and water or use of alcohol hand rub. Larger areas can be disinfected using 10% of diluted household bleach (made fresh daily). Ensure safe burial practices. Spraying of face/chest area of suspected pneumonic plague deaths should be discouraged. The area should be covered with a disinfectant-soaked cloth or absorbent material.

Surveillance and control

Surveillance and control requires investigating animal and flea species implicated in the plague cycle in the region and developing environmental management programmes to understand the natural zoonosis of the disease cycle and to limit spread. Active long-term surveillance of animal foci, coupled with a rapid response during animal outbreaks has successfully reduced numbers of human plague outbreaks.

In order to effectively and efficiently manage plague outbreaks it is crucial to have an informed and vigilant health care work force (and community) to quickly diagnose and manage patients with infection, to identify risk factors, to conduct ongoing surveillance, to control vectors and hosts, to confirm diagnosis with laboratory tests, and to communicate findings with appropriate authorities.

WHO Response

WHO aims to prevent plague outbreaks by maintaining surveillance and supporting at-risk countries to prepare. As the type of animal reservoir differs according to the region and influences the risk and conditions of human transmission, WHO has developed specific guidelines for the Indian sub-continent, South-America and Sub-Saharan Africa.

WHO works with ministries of health to support countries facing outbreaks for field control activities.
Answer: The context does not provide specific reasons for a decline in child burials during a plague outbreak. However, based on the information given, we can infer some possible reasons:

1. **Underreporting or Misreporting**: The parish registers might not have accurately recorded all child deaths due to various reasons, such as overwhelmed record-keeping systems or intentional underreporting to avoid panic.

2. **Differential Impact**: The plague might have affected adults more severely than children, leading to a relatively lower number of child deaths.

3. **Survival Bias**: Children who survived might have had stronger immune systems or were less exposed to the conditions that facilitated the spread of the plague.

4. **Migration or Evacuation**: Families with children might have left the area to escape the outbreak, resulting in fewer child burials recorded in the parish.

These are speculative reasons based on the context of historical plague outbreaks and the challenges in record-keeping during such crises.

Context: [RetrieverResultItem(content="{'id': ':2', 'index': 2, 'text': '10; Chase and Myers 2011; Tuomisto et al. 2012). In particular, it is recently proposed that deterministic processes gain importance and stochastic processes lose importance as a community enters a regime of more stressful conditions (e.g., Chase 2007, 2010; Guo et al. 2014; cf. Lepori and Malmqvist 2009). That is, if a system is under harshness, only a small subset of the regional species pool can pass through the associated environmental filters. Because the resulting species richness is low, the probability of ecological drift will reduce, leading to a community likely assembled by niche-driven processes (i.e., weak stochasticity) (Kim 2019).\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThis review of the major coexistence theories provides four insights. First, there are few general models that can be applied to many ecological systems with convincing results. Even the widely accepted niche differentiation hypothesis has faced strongly opposing viewpoints (especially from the competitive combining ability hypothesis) over decades. The contrasting theories of niche differentiation and competitive combining ability (or neutrality) are the key interests of this present work. Second, the lack of general models implies that ecologists are still far from understanding the mechanisms of species coexistence under harsh environmental conditions. Much remains to be discovered (e.g., coexistence by or without niche differentiation), beyond the hypothesis that the intensity of competitive interactions weakens near the stressful end of physical gradients. Third, due to the conventional emphasis on disturbance, stressful systems with non-lethal conditions have not received the attention they deserve. The ecology of such systems will be increasingly important as global climate change extends the period of chronic stresses that are not necessarily fatal to inhabiting plants. Finally, for decades, theories have been presented, but further empirical insights are required based on field data to test the various coexistence models at different spatial scales and in different ecosystems. We do not claim that our current research resolves these four issues. Rather, this paper provides a set of observational species composition data from a single marsh system, in which plant communities experience non-lethal stresses along an environmental gradient; it should be considered a springboard for more extensive experimental research in various ecological systems.\\n\\nHypothesis\\n\\nIn this research, we address a fundamental question, what are the patterns and possible mechanisms of plant species coexistence under very harsh but non-lethal environmental conditions? To rephrase, the community to be tested is not directly influenced by high-magnitude disturbing forces but shows a certain level of “well-defined, autogenic developmental trends” (Odum 1985). We broadly hypothesize that there will be an overall trend in species diversity along environmental stress gradients at the study marsh. In particular, following the general explanations of the environmental stress models explained above (Theory III: coexistence along environmental stress gradients), we expect that the highest diversity will be observed at the intermediate-level stresses along the environmental gradient we examine. However, this hypothesis might be rejected if, for example, we observe unexpectedly high species diversity even under very stressful conditions.\\n\\nPianka (1974), in his classic niche overlap hypothesis, predicted that the maximum tolerable niche overlap between two species should be an inverse function of the intensity of inter-specific competition. Therefore, both decreasing overlap (i.e., niche differentiation) and increasing species diversity will indicate highly intense diffuse competition (i.e., native species in a community compete among themselves). A corollary of this idea is that high-level species diversity implies high-level diffuse competition (MacArthur 1972), which in turn significantly lowers niche overlap (see also Russell et al. 1985; Silvertown 2004). We embody these ideas as a conceptual model along a resource gradient at different levels of species diversity (Fig. 1). In the model, we hypothesize that high diversity is maintained by niche differentiation and is associated with intense diffuse competition. In the case of low diversity, reduced competition allows niche overlap (i.e., resource sharing) to increase. Assuming that the three systems with different levels of species diversity in the model possess the same extent of resource niches, we expect that niche breadth should be high where diversity is low and low where diversity is high. Niche breadth is a measure of the evenness of resource utilization by species along given niche dimensions (Levins 1968). High and low niche breadths (i.e., high and low evenness) are, therefore, indicative of generalist and specialist species, respectively (Vandermeer 1972; Gravel et al. 2006; Finke and Snyder 2008).', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.7243409156799316, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:862'}), RetrieverResultItem(content="{'id': ':1', 'index': 1, 'text': 'ly affects the behavior of individual species, modes of biological interactions, and eventually, patterns of species coexistence and diversity in a plant community. One traditional belief in this regard has been that competition should be more intense in the benign and productive side of an environmental gradient, whereas the intensity decreases toward harsh conditions (i.e., stress gradient hypothesis; Bertness and Callaway 1994; Maestre et al. 2009; Holmgren and Scheffer 2010; Lee et al. 2018a, 2018b). In the former case, a (few) strong competitor(s) will outcompete inferior ones, thereby resulting in low-level diversity. In the latter, very high stresses allow only highly tolerant species to survive (i.e., reduction of species pool), and thus, species diversity is expected to be low. Intermediate-level harshness is predicted to compromise these two extreme situations and maximize biodiversity because a certain level of stresses prevents a superior competitor from monopolizing available resources, and such stresses secure space for stable populations of inferior species. In sum, retarded competitive exclusion because of physical harshness has been considered a major factor contributing to the maintenance of species coexistence (Grime 2001; Hart and Marshall 2013). Indeed, this notion provides the basis for influential classical theories of non-equilibrium coexistence, such as patch dynamics (Pickett 1980), the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell 1978), and Huston’s (1979) dynamic equilibrium model.\\n\\nThere are at least two theories associated with niche differentiation, indicating that one can observe high biodiversity even under highly stressful conditions. First, Tilman’s (1985) resource-ratio hypothesis suggests that high-level species coexistence can be achieved at low resource levels because the coexisting plants experience their environment as inherently spatially variable more than at high levels of resources. In a somewhat different context, Chesson and Huntly (1997) propose that stable coexistence may result easily from classical resource partitioning when strong environmental harshness makes existing tolerant species more equal in demographic rates. They conclude that, although harshness itself cannot stabilize species coexistence, it may facilitate or broaden the effects of other diversity-stabilizing mechanisms, such as resource partitioning and niche differentiation. In addition, facilitative biological interactions can be another important mechanism of species coexistence under environmental harshness (He and Berness 2014), as has been demonstrated in salt marshes (Bertness and Shumway 1993), arid ecosystems (Maestre and Cortina 2004), and alpine ecosystems (Callaway et al. 2002).\\n\\nTheory IV: coexistence under non-equilibrium versus equilibrium conditions\\n\\nMost of the environmental stress models discussed above exhibit one common characteristic that an important (and often imperative) component is the role of disturbance in shaping community structure and patterns of species diversity. Such a strong emphasis on disturbance implies that species coexistence is maintained under non-equilibrium states, in which disturbance events are frequent and strong enough to prevent a system from returning to its previous ecological phase before another disturbance event occurs (Connell 1978; Chesson 2000; Araújo and Pearson 2005). Consequently, a question arises concerning the general applicability of current theories of coexistence to communities that exhibit stressful conditions but limited and infrequent disturbances, that is, communities where a degree of equilibrium might be attained.\\n\\nMany theorists have been optimistic that disturbance-related models will be applicable to many different types of communities (but see Fox 2013). However, for example, Locke’s (1992) classic analyses of zooplankton communities along pH gradients (i.e., acidification stress) did not support such an expectation. She argued that it is questionable whether the level of physical disturbance included in the conventional models is comparable to the actual level of stresses that plant species perceive and respond to (see also reviews by Mackey and Currie 2001; Hughes et al. 2007). In short, the traditional disturbance-based models may not be robust if species in a system experience non-lethal environmental harshness.\\n\\nTheory V: modern perspectives\\n\\nAlthough the validity of niche theory has been recognized in community ecology, it also has limitations. First, it is suggested that the niche itself is an abstract concept (Chase and Leibold 2003; Araújo and Guisan 2006; Soberón and Nakamura 2009). Ambiguities in the original formulation of fundamental and realized niche concepts often result in conflicting interpretations as to what is truly a niche in the ecological system (Araújo and Guisan 2006). Furthermore, niche theory assumes the existence of stable conditions in, for example, required resources for species, but whether such conditions actually exist or are readily detectable in reality remains elusive (Torres 1984).\\n\\nNeutral theory has also faced several criticisms, arising mainly from its assumption that species are functionally equivalent and thus all individual species within a community have the same chances of reproduction and mortality regardless of their characteristics (Theory II: coexistence without niche differentiation). In real-world communities, many species exhibit large differences in traits. Therefore, if neutrality holds, these differences should be prone to fitness-equalizing tradeoffs, which is extremely unlikely (Purves and Turnbull 2010). In addition, as Hubbell (2001) acknowledged, stochastic processes associated with neutral theory do not predict coexistence patterns well at local spatial scales (Jabot and Chave 2011; Pos et al. 2019). Related to this is the question of whether perceived neutral processes might result from non-neutral mechanisms (Alonso et al. 2006). This is because neutral theory aggregates and averages the information on community assembly processes across sites, and this will blur deterministic mechanisms, making them appear as neutral dynamics (Clark 2012). However, in the last two decades, the neutral theory perspective has often been used to explain community assembly especially at regional scales (Chave 2004; Rosindell et al. 2011, 2012; Black and McKane 2012; Chesson 2013; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; D’Andrea and Ostling 2016). In addition, due to its simplicity and tractability, the theory still serves as a useful null hypothesis for complex biodiversity patterns (Rosindell et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Munoz and Huneman 2016).\\n\\nDespite its drawbacks in assumption, prediction, and measurement (Pocheville 2015), niche theory has also advanced in the new millennium (Adler et al. 2007; HilleRisLambers et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Munoz and Huneman 2016; Letten et al. 2017; Barabás et al. 2018). Ambiguous definitions of niches have been redefined through quantitative approaches of modern coexistence theory (Chesson 2000; Letten et al. 2017). Modern coexistence theory is based on the Lotka–Volterra model and examines community structure in relation to the influence of environmental factors on species interactions (Chesson 2000, 2013; Adler et al. 2007; Ellner et al. 2019). In a theory-based model, complex interactions between species in a community are simplified into competition coefficients, which reflect intra- and inter-specific effects on per capita growth rate (Letten et al. 2017). Under modern coexistence theory, niche and fitness differences are controlling factors that allow species to coexist in the same community. The niche difference is part of a stabilizing mechanism that differentiates niches among species within a community to decrease competition and thus optimize the chance of survival. On the contrary, the equalizing mechanism balances fitness differences between species, thereby contributing to species coexistence (HilleRisLambers et al. 2012). The stabilizing niche differences can be reduced as the average fitness differences decrease. In other words, when niche differences are larger than relative fitness differences, species in a community can stably coexist (Chesson 2000).\\n\\nContemporary niche theory is developed from the consumer–resource model (Tilman 1982) and provides an explicit basis for coexistence (Chase and Leibold 2003). While Tilman’s model focuses on the dynamics of the consumer–resource system, Chase and Leibold (2003) expand the range of this model from interactions between biotic factors to interactions between biotic and abiotic factors (Letten et al. 2017). A major difference between modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory lies in the ways they define niche. For modern coexistence theory, boundaries of niches are defined through an interaction between two or more species. Under contemporary niche theory, in contrast, niches indicate particular traits of an individual species, and the niches of multiple species within a community can sometimes overlap.\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been a growing body of researchers trying to integrate the niche and neutral perspectives (Adler et al. 2007; Chisholm and Pacala 2010; Pigolotti and Cencini 2013; Kalyuzhny et al. 2015). In particular, a number of studies have demonstrated theoretically and empirically that both niche-based stabilizing mechanisms and neutral-based equalizing mechanisms appear to operate simultaneously along the continuum of environmental stress gradients in many ecological systems (Gravel et al. 2006; Mutshinda and O’Hara 2011; Jeraldo et al. 2012; Matthews and Whittaker 2014; Scheffer et al. 2018; Ellner et al. 2019; Kim 2019). Accordingly, the focus today is increasingly on understanding the relative importance of these two mechanisms for species composition and diversity under different environmental conditions (Smith and Lundholm 20', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.7165474891662598, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:861'})]
Answer: The decline in child burials during a plague outbreak, as observed in a parish register, could be attributed to several possible reasons:

1. **Higher Mortality Rates Among Adults**: The plague might have disproportionately affected adults, leading to a higher number of adult burials and a relative decline in the proportion of child burials.

2. **Survivorship Bias**: Children who survived the initial outbreak might have had stronger immune systems, leading to fewer deaths among children as the outbreak progressed.

3. **Reporting Bias**: There could be inaccuracies in the recording of child burials, either due to oversight or prioritization of adult burials in the records.

4. **Population Structure Changes**: The outbreak might have led to changes in the population structure, such as a decrease in the birth rate or an increase in the number of children being sent away to safer areas, resulting in fewer child deaths locally.

5. **Social and Cultural Factors**: There might have been social or cultural practices during the outbreak that affected the recording or reporting of child deaths differently than adult deaths.

These factors, individually or in combination, could contribute to the observed decline in child burials during a plague outbreak.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Though technology companies announced massive layoffs last year, 2023 has been much worse. Layoffs have far outpaced last year's cuts, as tech giants including Amazon, Facebook parent company Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, and Salesforce — as well as many smaller companies — announce sweeping job cuts.

The problem: Big Tech went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce, and now they face revenue declines.

Although global IT spending is forecast to rise in 2023, with enterprise software and IT services experiencing the greatest growth, the overall increase is expected to be modest, with data center systems and communications services growing by less than 1%, according to market research firm Gartner. Meanwhile hardware sales are forecast to decline.

Continuing supply chain issues, inflation, and the war in Ukraine are also having an impact on both business and consumer spending, leading to fears of recession.

According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 784 tech companies have laid off about 208,181 staff so far this year, compared to 164,411 layoffs last year.

Here is a list — to be updated regularly — of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently.

July 2023

Evernote, the maker of the note-taking app of the same name, is laying off most of its staff in the US and Chile and moving to Italy, the home of its corporate parent, Bending Spoons. "Going forward, a dedicated (and growing) team based in Europe will continue to assume ownership of the Evernote product," company CEO Francesco Patarnello said in a message to employees. He did not specify the number of staff to be laid off, but said that affected employees in most cases will receive 16 weeks of salary, up to one year of health insurance coverage, and a performance bonus. Bending Spoons, which acquired Evernote in November last year, had enacted a round of layoffs in February that affected more than 100 employees.
A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs From major layoffs at Google, Amazon and Microsoft to small fintech startups and apps

Last year’s techwide reckoning continues. In 2023, layoffs have yet again cost tens of thousands of tech workers their jobs; this time, the workforce reductions have been driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups, too, have announced cuts across all sectors, from crypto to enterprise SaaS.

The reasoning behind these workforce reductions follows a common script, citing the macroeconomic environment and a need to find discipline on a tumultuous path to profitability. Still, tracking the layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. It also, unfortunately, serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles may be changing from here.

Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here.

The running total of layoffs for 2023 based on full months to date is 201,860, according to Layoffs.fyi. Tech layoffs conducted to date this year currently exceed the total number of tech layoffs in 2022, according to the data in the tracker.

Answer: The context does not provide a direct answer to whether it is safer to become an entrepreneur due to the industry-wide layoffs in tech. However, it does highlight the challenges faced by tech companies, such as revenue declines, macroeconomic pressures, and the need for profitability, which have led to significant layoffs. These factors suggest a volatile environment for tech employees, but they do not necessarily imply that entrepreneurship is a safer option. Entrepreneurship carries its own risks and uncertainties, and the decision to pursue it would depend on individual circumstances, market opportunities, and personal risk tolerance.

Answer: The current industry-wide layoffs in the tech sector highlight the volatility and uncertainty in the job market, which might make entrepreneurship seem like an attractive alternative. However, becoming an entrepreneur also carries its own risks and challenges, especially in a tumultuous economic environment. Factors such as supply chain issues, inflation, and geopolitical tensions are impacting both established companies and startups. While entrepreneurship offers the potential for innovation and independence, it also requires careful consideration of market conditions, financial stability, and personal risk tolerance. Therefore, whether it is "safer" to become an entrepreneur depends on individual circumstances and the ability to navigate the inherent risks of starting and running a business.

RACIAL IMPLICATIONS

STATUS OF THE OUT OF AFRICA HYPOTHESIS

BIBLIOGRAPHY

The “Out of Africa” hypothesis is an evolutionary theory of modern human origin that posits that modern humans arose in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000–200,000 years ago, in Africa. There are different versions of “Out of Africa,” but its major tenet is that modern humans originated as a discrete population or species that rapidly expanded and replaced archaic humans that were indigenous to other parts of the Old World: Homo erectus (or its descendents) in East and South Asia, and Neanderthals in Europe. In the most common version of Out of Africa, modern humans are considered a new species, with negligible gene-flow (mating) between the migrating African people and the indigenous archaic groups. Therefore, the Out of Africa hypothesis, as it is most generally understood, posits that the African population is the unique Pleistocene ancestor of all living humans. The other groups of archaic humans essentially died out and became evolutionary dead ends.

The Out of Africa hypothesis gained rapid acceptance in the late 1980s, with pioneering analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which revealed very low mean nucleotide variation between the mtDNA of individuals from diverse populations (Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson 1987). This suggested that the species was young, since one interpretation of low levels of variation is that there was a genetic bottleneck in the recent past, such as would occur at speciation, and little time since then for subsequent variation to accrue. Moreover, the fact that more variation occurred in African groups suggested Africa as the source. The Out of Africa, or mitochondrial “Eve Theory” as it is also known, has been promoted as underscoring the close relationship between all living humans, and the theory therefore gained ascendancy for sociopolitical reasons as well as scientific ones (Gould 1988).

The Out of Africa hypothesis is sometimes dubbed “Out of Africa 2” because it is not the first migration of Homo out of Africa. It is well accepted that the hominid lineage (the unique human lineage since divergence from the last common ancestor with chimpanzees) evolved in Africa, and for two-thirds of its 6-million-year history was an exclusively African clade. However, at the beginning of the Pleistocene 1.8 million years ago, soon after the emergence of the genus, Homo, hominids are found outside of Africa. These archaic Homo populations expanded from Africa to parts of Eurasia in the early Pleistocene, and subsequent populations were able to adapt to more temperate, colder, and even glacial environments in the Ice Ages. The question that the Out of Africa hypothesis addresses concerns the emergence of modern humans: Do modern human beings represent a new species that arose in Africa recently (in the last 200,000 years) and that replaced the earlier migrants?

Throughout the nineteenth and much of the twentieth centuries, the question of modern human origin was subsumed into the context of the “origin of races” (Howells 1942). Racial thinking dominated the science of human variation; the human species was thought to be composed of a number of discrete types of people (“races”) who had separate origins (Stanton 1960), and after the rise of Darwinian thinking, separate evolutionary histories (Figure 1). These separate evolutionary histories were envisioned and depicted as nonreticulating (nonrecombining) branches of phylogenetic trees (Brace 1981). Workers differed on the number and constituents of different racial groups and when in the past they shared a common ancestor, but the “tree” model of human variation, implicit in the race concept, generally prevailed (Caspari 2003). Many workers believed in a few (three to five) primary races (such as Africans, Europeans, and Asians), and then multiple “secondary” and “tertiary” races, all of which could be represented as branches, or twigs, on an evolutionary tree (Coon, Garn, and Bird-sell 1950).

Tree models are unrealistic representations of the relationships between human populations because they fail to represent gene-flow between human groups (Moore 1994). However, they are a part of the construction of “race” because they represent an easily conceived and visualized mechanism to explain human differences—a process of continual isolation, branching, and separation (Caspari 2003).

Evolutionary trees were also used to explain inequality. Some influential nineteenth-century evolutionary trees (Figure 2) depicted European racial groups with longer branches than other groups, implying that they are “more evolved.” The perceived inferiority, and shorter branches, of other racial groups were considered the consequence of their unique evolutionary histories. Racial thinking and the concomitant branching models were so widely accepted that the alternative view—that of a “network” or “trellis” depicting the evolution of the human species as interconnected groups—was largely ignored, or misinterpreted (Figure 3).

Thus, the question of “the origin of races” focused on whether human races had a recent or an ancient common ancestor. Some models, reminiscent of the polygenism of the “American School” of the early

nineteenth century, postulated a very ancient origin of races. This was epitomized by Carleton Coon’s The Origin of Races (1963), in which the five major races Coon recognized were thought to have very long and separate evolutionary histories, sharing a common ancestor prior to the emergence of Homo sapiens. According to Coon, the five races crossed the threshold between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens at different times, and the length of time that races were in the “sapiens” state was related to their cultural “advancement.” Coon wrote that Europeans and Asians crossed the threshold earlier and Africans and Australians considerably later.

This work, first published in 1963, had clear political implications, and was used as propaganda against school desegregation in the early 1960s (Jackson 2001). While Coon’s overt linkage of polygenism to racial discrimination caused a backlash in the anthropological community, with many anthropologists and other scientists denouncing Coon (Dobzhansky 1963; Hulse 1963; Montagu 1964), the tree premise on which his model was based has been more ingrained. For most, tree versus network thinking as applied to human variation was not a focus of the debate. The tree was the dominant model and the question was whether the root of the tree was recent or ancient. By equating gene trees with population trees, tree metaphors are still inappropriately used to reflect relationships between human populations.

Modern thinking on Out of Africa began in the 1970s with the argument that because fossils phenotypically resembling recent humans are found in Africa earlier than anywhere else, “modern humans” originated there (Protsch 1975). Gunter Bräuer (1978, 1984) subsequently used new evidence to argue that Europeans must be of African descent. However, in arguing for African ancestry, neither Protsch nor Bräuer contended that early humans of modern form in Africa implied unique African origins. The Out of Africa hypothesis— the idea of an African origin for a recent modern human species—owes its genesis to interpretations of mtDNA, which suggested that the ancestors of recent humans first appeared in Africa and replaced other populations because they were a new species that did not interbreed (Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson 1987; Stoneking and Cann 1989). This model of replacement without mixture in the process of recent human origin was accepted by some paleoanthropologists (Stringer and Andrews 1988) and remains an influential model in the early 2000s.

The Out of Africa hypothesis, the theory of a recent unique African origin for the modern human species, was supported by early interpretations of the variation of mtDNA (Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson 1987; Stoneking and Cann 1989). Advances in gene sequencing technology in the 1980s provided the techniques to sequence the mitochondrial genome, and Rebecca Cann initially compared mtDNA variants from representatives of several different populations. Mitochondria are organelles in the cytoplasm of cells, which play an important role in cell metabolism. Their DNA consists of a single chromo-some, which is inherited maternally and does not recombine. It reproduces by mitosis, so all variation between mitochondria is a consequence of mutation. Assuming that mtDNA is selectively neutral and assuming constant population size, the amount of variation (number of nucleotide differences) between individuals and populations was interpreted to be a consequence of two factors: mutation rate and time since divergence of the mtDNA

lineages. Therefore, given the same mutation rate, two mitochondria with fewer nucleotide differences would have a more recent common ancestor than two with a larger number of nucleotide differences.

Gene trees, like evolutionary trees in general, are hierarchical structures based on a particular gene or locus (these may be single nucleotides, haplotypes, genes, or the entire genome, which can be practical when the genome is short); variants of a gene that share more mutations are clustered together. The mtDNA gene trees derived from Cann’s work were rooted in Africa, based on the observations that more variation was found in Africa and that all human populations had some African mitochondrial variants. The time of this root, based on the mutation rate derived for mtDNA (assuming neutrality), was estimated to be between 100,000–200,000 years ago. In the creation of the “Eve Theory” (as the Out of Africa hypothesis was frequently called), this gene tree was interpreted as a population tree and the root was thought to represent a population bottleneck, a massive reduction in population size where variation is greatly reduced. Such population bottlenecks often accompany speciations, and hence the mtDNA data were thought to reflect the time and place of the birth of the modern human species.

In the twenty years since this early research, genetic analyses have become far more sophisticated; in addition to mtDNA (which, because it does not recombine and is inherited as a single unit, can be considered only one gene), many nuclear genes now contribute to our understanding of human evolution, and the evolutionary models based on genetics have become more complicated. It is now widely understood that many factors, from population size and structure to natural selection, affect genetic variation and that different genes have different histories; in other words, gene trees are not population trees. Because of recombination, autosomal genes within the same individual will have very different evolutionary trees. Different genes reflect different aspects of our ancestry; moreover, if natural selection is acting on a gene, it may give no information about population history at all. The trees of some genes, particularly those on chromosomes that do not recombine, such as mtDNA and part of the Y chromosome, have shallow roots; other loci have roots that are millions of years old.

The Out of Africa theory is based on the loci whose evolutionary trees have shallow roots through the assumption that the recent root of the gene tree represents the recent root of the human species. However, it is now recognized that there are many potential explanations for the shallow roots of these gene trees: The relative effective population size of haploid loci is four times smaller than that of the autosomes, which alone causes the roots of their gene trees to be four times shallower; variations in past population sizes affect the structure and roots of gene trees; and perhaps most importantly, natural selection may have a larger effect on non-recombining loci because of the effects of linkage. For example, selection favoring one locus on the mitochondrial genome affects the entire mitochondrial chromosome because it is inherited together. Given the importance of mitochondria in many functions of cell metabolism, such selection and selective sweeps are highly probable. Any selective sweep affecting mtDNA (or any other locus) will reduce variation and give gene trees an even shallower root. Therefore, Out of Africa (or a population bottleneck at speciation) is only one of many possible explanations for the genetic observations of loci with shallow rooted gene trees (Garrigan and Hammer 2006; Templeton 1998, 2002; Relethford 1998, 2001).

Much of the current genetic evidence is incompatible with the Out of Africa scenario because it does not reflect a bottleneck associated with recent speciation. While there are a number of nuclear loci that do fit the hypothesis (i.e., autosomal loci with roots four times as deep as the mtDNA and loci on the nonrecombining Y), the rate of discovery of loci with deep genealogical histories is rapidly increasing, and some of these have roots outside of Africa (Garrigan and Hammer 2006). The new evidence argues against a recent population bottleneck (speciation) because many genetic loci did not undergo reduction in variation at that time and there is no evidence of the postspeciation population expansions in Africa that would be expected under the Out of Africa model. Moreover, genealogical roots outside of Africa provide evidence of gene-flow between archaic humans in different regions, indicating that they were not separate species. Therefore, recent genetic research suggests that a simple, single origin model for the evolution of modern humans is incorrect, and that the genome of modern humans consists of contributions from multiple archaic populations. However, the many loci that have a recent common ancestor in Africa, as well as the early appearance of many modern skeletal features there, indicate the importance of Africa for the origin of modern humans.

The alternatives to the Out of Africa hypothesis are versions of “Multiregional Evolution,” a model that hypothesizes evolutionary change within the human species with gene flow between “archaic” and “modern” humans rather than evolution due to recent speciation. The multiregional theory does not recognize Pleistocene Africans and archaic groups from Europe and Asia as different species. According to the multiregional model, gene-flow was an integral part of the evolution of modern peoples, dispersing adaptive genes throughout the species, and any one living human is likely to have had Pleistocene ancestors from different parts of the globe. Developed by Franz Weidenreich (1947) as “polycentric theory” in the 1940s, it differed from the prevailing evolutionary models in being network based rather than tree based; it was a reticulating model depicting the evolution of human populations as an intraspecific process, with gene-flow at its core.

Weaker versions of the Out of Africa hypothesis, such as the “Assimilation Theory” (Smith, Jankovic, and Karavanic 2005), where modern humans are a population, or deme, rather than a species are consistent with the multiregional gene-flow model because they do not involve speciation. Contemporary versions of multiregionalism reflect the importance of Africa in modern human origins. The contemporary multiregional model (Wolpoff, Wu, and Thorne 1984; Wolpoff 1989), in its center-and-edge contention, proposed that Africa was a significant source of new genetic variants during human evolution, because throughout human evolution the predominant direction of gene-flow was from the more densely occupied center (Africa) to the more sparsely occupied edges (Europe, East Asia, Australia). The hallmarks of the Out of Africa hypothesis are also addressed by multiregional evolution: Low genetic diversity among human populations is explained through gene-flow rather than recency of origin, and the greater genetic diversity in Africa is explained by larger population size, greater ecological diversity, and natural selection. The inequality of Pleistocene population sizes and the evolutionary consequences of the dominance of African population size have been widely discussed (Harpending, Batzer, and Gurven 1989; Harpending 1996; Relethford 2001; Hawks and Wolpoff 2003). Because of these factors, Africa has provided the strongest regional contribution to modern humans, which is observable genetically and morphologically, but genetic and morphological data also suggest that gene-flow occurred between African and non-African populations. Therefore, while current evidence suggests that the Out of Africa speciation model is incorrect, Africa played a predominant role in Pleistocene human evolution and the origin of modern humans.

Race is intricately involved in human origin theories because these theories address the origin and nature of human biological variation. For many historical reasons, and perhaps some psychological ones, race impacts our understanding of human variation in a circular way: Folk (or social) understandings of variation (race) influence science, and conversely, science has been used to validate social meanings of race (Wolpoff and Caspari 1997).

The Out of Africa hypothesis is no exception. When it was first proposed, it was used to validate progressive political positions; it gained considerable publicity as underscoring the close relationships of living humans. As Steven J. Gould put it in 1988 (p. 21), “Human unity is no idle political slogan … all modern humans form an entity united by physical bonds of descent from a recent African root.”

The idea that the mtDNA ancestor reflected the root of all human populations meant that we all share common ancestors from less than 200,000 years ago, underscoring the “brotherhood of man,” and this view was thought to undermine the race concept. Conversely, the Out of Africa hypothesis has also been used to emphasize the importance of racial difference. Sarich and Miele (2004), for example, have argued that since the species is young, “race” must be biologically important: With little time for differences to accrue, there must have been isolation, strong selection, and different evolutionary histories. Thus, the same theory can be used to support conflicting political ideologies.

This entry has explored the relationship between the concept of race and evolutionary theories of the origin of modern humans, in particular the Out of Africa hypothesis. It is ironic that the Out of Africa theory, while recently promoted as proof of the “brotherhood of man,” inadvertently undermines this important concept because the assumptions that underlie the model are dependent on an unrealistic “tree model” of human variation—a view that is a legacy of the race concept. Fossil and genetic data support the hypothesis that there was gene-flow both between modern and archaic populations, and between geographic groups of modern humans after their emergence.

However, while recent evidence no longer supports the Out of Africa hypothesis per se, Africa remains important in all theories of modern human origin. Africa was the center of Pleistocene human evolution: Modern human form appears there first, and Africa made the largest regional contribution to the gene pool of modern humans. Africa is central to both single origin and multiregional models of modern human origin. Therefore, while it seems increasingly likely that some gene-flow occurred between African and non-African populations both before and after the emergence of modern humans, and the “new species” version of the Out of Africa hypothesis appears to be incorrect, the importance of Africa as a central region for the evolution of recent humans is well supported.

Answer: The "Out of Africa" hypothesis is an evolutionary theory that suggests modern humans originated in Africa during the late Pleistocene, approximately 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The hypothesis posits that modern humans emerged as a distinct population or species in Africa and then rapidly expanded, replacing archaic human populations in other parts of the Old World, such as Homo erectus in East and South Asia and Neanderthals in Europe. The most common version of this hypothesis suggests that there was negligible gene flow between the migrating African populations and the indigenous archaic groups, making the African population the unique Pleistocene ancestor of all living humans. The hypothesis gained support in the late 1980s through analyses of mitochondrial DNA, which indicated low genetic variation among humans, suggesting a recent common origin. The theory is sometimes referred to as "Out of Africa 2" to distinguish it from earlier migrations of Homo species out of Africa. While recent genetic evidence challenges the idea of a simple, single origin model, Africa remains central to theories of modern human origins due to its significant contribution to the gene pool of modern humans.

There are different versions of “Out of Africa,” but its major tenet is that modern humans originated as a discrete population or species that rapidly expanded and replaced archaic humans that were indigenous to other parts of the Old World: Homo erectus (or its descendents) in East and South Asia, and Neanderthals in Europe. In the most common version of Out of Africa, modern humans are considered a new species, with negligible gene-flow (mating) between the migrating African people and the indigenous archaic groups. Therefore, the Out of Africa hypothesis, as it is most generally understood, posits that the African population is the unique Pleistocene ancestor of all living humans. The other groups of archaic humans essentially died out and became evolutionary dead ends.\\n\\nThe Out of Africa hypothesis gained rapid acceptance in the late 1980s, with pioneering analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which revealed very low mean nucleotide variation between the mtDNA of individuals from diverse populations (Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson 1987). This suggested that the species was young, since one interpretation of low levels of variation is that there was a genetic bottleneck in the recent past, such as would occur at speciation, and little time since then for subsequent variation to accrue. Moreover, the fact that more variation occurred in African groups suggested Africa as the source. The Out of Africa, or mitochondrial “Eve Theory” as it is also known, has been promoted as underscoring the close relationship between all living humans, and the theory therefore gained ascendancy for sociopolitical reasons as well as scientific ones (Gould 1988).\\n\\nThe Out of Africa hypothesis is sometimes dubbed “Out of Africa 2” because it is not the first migration of Homo out of Africa. It is well accepted that the hominid lineage (the unique human lineage since divergence from the last common ancestor with chimpanzees) evolved in Africa, and for two-thirds of its 6-million-year history was an exclusively African clade. However, at the beginning of the Pleistocene 1.8 million years ago, soon after the emergence of the genus, Homo, hominids are found outside of Africa. These archaic Homo populations expanded from Africa to parts of Eurasia in the early Pleistocene, and subsequent populations were able to adapt to more temperate, colder, and even glacial environments in the Ice Ages. The question that the Out of Africa hypothesis addresses concerns the emergence of modern humans: Do modern human beings represent a new species that arose in Africa recently (in the last 200,000 years) and that replaced the earlier migrants?\\n\\nThroughout the nineteenth and much of the twentieth centuries, the question of modern human origin was subsumed into the context of the “origin of races” (Howells 1942). Racial thinking dominated the science of human variation; the human species was thought to be composed of a number of discrete types of people (“races”) who had separate origins (Stanton 1960), and after the rise of Darwinian thinking, separate evolutionary histories (Figure 1). These separate evolutionary histories were envisioned and depicted as nonreticulating (nonrecombining) branches of phylogenetic trees (Brace 1981). Workers differed on the number and constituents of different racial groups and when in the past they shared a common ancestor, but the “tree” model of human variation, implicit in the race concept, generally prevailed (Caspari 2003). Many workers believed in a few (three to five) primary races (such as Africans, Europeans, and Asians), and then multiple “secondary” and “tertiary” races, all of which could be represented as branches, or twigs, on an evolutionary tree (Coon, Garn, and Bird-sell 1950).\\n\\nTree models are unrealistic representations of the relationships between human populations because they fail to represent gene-flow between human groups (Moore 1994). However, they are a part of the construction of “race” because they represent an easily conceived and visualized mechanism to explain human differences—a process of continual isolation, branching, and separation (Caspari 2003).\\n\\nEvolutionary trees were also used to explain inequality. Some influential nineteenth-century evolutionary trees (Figure 2) depicted European racial groups with longer branches than other groups, implying that they are “more evolved.” The perceived inferiority, and shorter branches, of other racial groups were considered the consequence of their unique evolutionary histories. Racial thinking and the concomitant branching models were so widely accepted that the alternative view—that of a “network” or “trellis” depicting the evolution of the human species as interconnected groups—was largely ignored, or misinterpreted (Figure 3).\\n\\nThus, the question of “the origin of races” focused on whether human races had a recent or an ancient common ancestor. Some models, reminiscent of the polygenism of the “American School” of the early\\n\\nnineteenth century, postulated a very ancient origin of races. This was epitomized by Carleton Coon’s The Origin of Races (1963), in which the five major races Coon recognized were thought to have very long and separate evolutionary histories, sharing a common ancestor prior to the emergence of Homo sapiens. According to Coon, the five races crossed the threshold between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens at different times, and the length of time that races were in the “sapiens” state was related to their cultural “advancement.” Coon wrote that Europeans and Asians crossed the threshold earlier and Africans and Australians considerably later.\\n\\nThis work, first published in 1963, had clear political implications, and was used as propaganda against school desegregation in the early 1960s (Jackson 2001). While Coon’s overt linkage of polygenism to racial discrimination caused a backlash in the anthropological community, with many anthropologists and other scientists denouncing Coon (Dobzhansky 1963; Hulse 1963; Montagu 1964), the tree premise on which his model was based has been more ingrained. For most, tree versus network thinking as applied to human variation was not a focus of the debate. The tree was the dominant model and the question was whether the root of the tree was recent or ancient. By equating gene trees with population trees, tree metaphors are still inappropriately used to reflect relationships between human populations.\\n\\nModern thinking on Out of Africa began in the 1970s with the argument that because fossils phenotypically resembling recent humans are found in Africa earlier than anywhere else, “modern humans” originated there (Protsch 1975). Gunter Bräuer (1978, 1984) subsequently used new evidence to argue that Europeans must be of African descent. However, in arguing for African ancestry, neither Protsch nor Bräuer contended that early humans of modern form in Africa implied unique African origins. The Out of Africa hypothesis— the idea of an African origin for a recent modern human species—owes its genesis to interpretations of mtDNA, which suggested that the ancestors of recent humans first appeared in Africa and replaced other populations because they were a new species that did not interbreed (Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson 1987; Stoneking and Cann 1989). This model of replacement without mixture in the process of recent human origin was accepted by some paleoanthropologists (Stringer and Andrews 1988) and remains an influential model in the early 2000s.\\n\\nThe Out of Africa hypothesis, the theory of a recent unique African origin for the modern human species, was supported by early interpretations of the variation of mtDNA (Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson 1987; Stoneking and Cann 1989). Advances in gene sequencing technology in the 1980s provided the techniques to sequence the mitochondrial genome, and Rebecca Cann initially compared mtDNA variants from representatives of several different populations. Mitochondria are organelles in the cytoplasm of cells, which play an important role in cell metabolism. Their DNA consists of a single chromo-some, which is inherited maternally and does not recombine. It reproduces by mitosis, so all variation between mitochondria is a consequence of mutation. Assuming that mtDNA is selectively neutral and assuming constant population size, the amount of variation (number of nucleotide differences) between individuals and populations was interpreted to be a consequence of two factors: mutation rate and time since divergence of the mtDNA\\n\\nlineages. Therefore, given the same mutation rate, two mitochondria with fewer nucleotide differences would have a more recent common ancestor than two with a larger number of nucleotide differences.\\n\\nGene trees, like evolutionary trees in general, are hierarchical structures based on a particular gene or locus (these may be single nucleotides, haplotypes, genes, or the entire genome, which can be practical when the genome is short); variants of a gene that share more mutations are clustered together. The mtDNA gene trees derived from Cann’s work were rooted in Africa, based on the observations that more variation was found in Africa and that all human populations had some African mitochondrial variants. The time of this root, based on the mutation rate derived for mtDNA (assuming neutrality), was estimated to be between 100,000–200,000 years ago.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: An autoclave is a machine that provides a physical method of sterilization by killing bacteria, viruses, and even spores present in the material put inside of the vessel using steam under pressure.

Autoclave sterilizes the materials by heating them up to a particular temperature for a specific period of time. The autoclave is also called a steam sterilizer that is commonly used in healthcare facilities and industries for various purposes. The autoclave is considered a more effective method of sterilization as it is based on moist heat sterilization.

Image Source: Wikipedia, https://ilabot.blogspot.com/, and Wikipedia.

Autoclave Parts/ Components

The simplest form of the autoclave is the pressure cooker type or laboratory bench autoclaves. The following is the detailed description of different components/ parts of an autoclave:

Figure: Autoclave Parts or Components. Image Source: pharmawiki.

a. Pressure Chamber

The pressure chamber is the main component of a steam autoclave consisting of an inner chamber and an outer jacket.

The inner chamber is made up of stainless steel or gunmetal, which is present inside the out chamber made up of an iron case.

The autoclaves used in healthcare laboratories have an outer jacket that is filled with steam to reduce the time taken to reach the sterilization temperature.

The inner chamber is the case where the materials to be sterilized are put.

The size of the pressure chamber ranges from 100 L to 3000 L.

b. Lid/ Door

The next important component of an autoclave is the lid or door of the autoclave.

The purpose of the lid is to seal off the outside atmosphere and create a sterilized condition on ht inside of the autoclave.

The lid is made airtight via the screw clamps and asbestos washer.

The lid consists of various other components like:

Pressure gauge

A pressure gauge is present on the lid of the autoclave to indicate the pressure created in the autoclave during sterilization.

The pressure gauge is essential as it assures the safety of the autoclave and the working condition of the operation.

Pressure releasing unit/ Whistle

A whistle is present on the lid of the autoclave is the same as that of the pressure cooker.

The whistle controls the pressure inside the chamber by releasing a certain amount of vapor by lifting itself.

Safety valve

A safety valve is present on the lid of the autoclave, which is crucial in cases where the autoclave fails to perform its action or the pressure inside increases uncontrollably.

The valve has a thin layer of rubber that bursts itself to release the pressure and to avoid the danger of explosion.

c. Steam generator/ Electrical heater

An electrical steam generator or boiler is present underneath the chamber that uses an electric heating system to heat the water and generate steam in the inner and the outer chamber.

The level of water present in the inner chamber is vital as if the water is not sufficient; there are chances of the burning of the heating system.

Similarly, if the water is more than necessary, it might interfere with the trays and other components present inside the chamber.

d. Vacuum generator (if applicable)

In some types of autoclaves, a separate vacuum generator is present which pulls out the air from the inside of the chamber to create a vacuum inside the chamber.

The presence of some air pockets inside the chamber might support the growth of different microorganisms. This is why the vacuum chamber is an important component of an autoclave.

e. Wastewater cooler

Many autoclaves are provided with a system to cool the effluent before it enters the draining pipes.

This system prevents any damage to the drainage pipe due to the boiling water being sent out of the autoclave.

Autoclave Principle/ Working

Figure: Autoclave Principle or Working.

The autoclave works on the principle of moist heat sterilization where steam under pressure is used to sterilize the material present inside the chamber.

The high pressure increases the boiling point of water and thus helps achieve a higher temperature for sterilization.

Water usually boils at 100°C under normal atmospheric pressure (760 mm of Hg); however, the boiling point of water increases if the pressure is to be increased.

Similarly, the high pressure also facilitates the rapid penetration of heat into deeper parts of the material, and moisture present in the steam causes the coagulation of proteins causing an irreversible loss of function and activity of microbes.

This principle is employed in an autoclave where the water boils at 121°C at the pressure of 15 psi or 775 mm of Hg.

When this steam comes in contact with the surface, it kills the microbes by giving off latent heat.

The condensed liquid ensures the moist killing of the microbes.

Once the sterilization phase is completed (which depends on the level of contamination of material inside), the pressure is released from the inside of the chamber through the whistle.

The pressure inside the chamber is then restored back to the ambient pressure while the components inside remain hot for some time.

Procedure for running an autoclave

In general, an autoclave is run at a temperature of 121° C for at least 30 minutes by using saturated steam under at least 15 psi of pressure. The following are the steps to be followed while running an autoclave:

Before beginning to use the autoclave, it should be checked for any items left from the previous cycle. A sufficient amount of water is then put inside the chamber. Now, the materials to be sterilized are placed inside the chamber. The lid is then closed, and the screws are tightened to ensure an airtight condition, and the electric heater is switched on. The safety valves are adjusted to maintain the required pressure in the chamber. Once the water inside the chamber boils, the air-water mixture is allowed to escape through the discharge tube to let all the air inside to be displaced. The complete displacement can be ensured once the water bubbles cease to come out from the pipe. The drainage pipe is then closed, and the steam inside is allowed to reach the desired levels (15 lbs in most cases). Once the pressure is reached, the whistle blows to remove excess pressure from the chamber. After the whistle, the autoclave is run for a holding period, which is 15 minutes in most cases. Now, the electric heater is switched off, and the autoclave is allowed to cool until the pressure gauge indicates the pressure inside has lowered down to that of the atmospheric pressure. The discharge pipe is then opened to allow the entry of air from the outside into the autoclave. Finally, the lid is opened, and the sterilized materials are taken out of the chamber.

Types of Autoclave

There are different types of autoclaves present in the market, some of which are:

Pressure cooker type/ Laboratory bench autoclaves (N-type)

These, as domestic pressure cookers, are still in use in many parts of the world.

The more modern type has a metal chamber with a secure metal lid that can be fastened and sealed with a rubber gasket.

It has an air and steam discharge tap, pressure gauge, and safety valve. There is an electric immersion heater at the bottom of the chamber.

Gravity displacement type autoclave

This is the common type of autoclave used in laboratories.

In this type of autoclave, the steam is created inside the chamber via the heating unit, which then moves around the chamber for sterilization.

This type of autoclave is comparatively cheaper than other types.

Positive pressure displacement type (B-type)

In this type of autoclave, the steam is generated in a separate steam generator which is then passed into the autoclave.

This autoclave is faster as the steam can be generated within seconds.

This type of autoclave is an improvement over the gravity displacement type.

Negative pressure displacement type (S-type)

This is another type of autoclave that contains both the steam generator as well as a vacuum generator.

Here, the vacuum generator pulls out all the air from inside the autoclave while the steam generator creates steam.

The steam is then passed into the autoclave.

This is the most recommended type of autoclave as it is very accurate and achieves a high sterility assurance level.

This is also the most expensive type of autoclave.

Uses of Autoclave

Autoclaves are important devices to ensure the sterilization of materials containing water as they cannot be sterilized by dry heat sterilization. Besides, autoclaves are used for various other purposes.

They are used to decontaminate specific biological waste and sterilize media, instruments, and labware. Regulated medical waste that might contain bacteria, viruses, and other biological materials is recommended to be inactivated by autoclaving before disposal. In medical labs, autoclaves are used to sterilize medical equipment, glassware, surgical equipment, and medical wastes. Similarly, autoclaves are used for the sterilization of culture media, autoclavable containers, plastic tubes, and pipette tips.

Precautions

Although autoclaves are pretty simple to use, there are certain rules of precautions to be followed while operating an autoclave. Some of the important precautions to be followed while running an autoclave are:

7 Common Autoclave Problems You Should be Aware Of

In an ideal world, laboratory autoclaves would always work exactly as intended. Unfortunately, issues can and do arise — the key to resolving them is knowing what to look for.

In this article, we’ll outline seven of the most common autoclave problems and how to identify them.

1. The sterilizer won’t reach the temperature set-point.

Autoclave users have the ability to customize sterilization cycles based on a number of parameters, including sterilization temperature. If the autoclave fails to reach the designated temperature in the time it takes to run the sterilization cycle, it will either abort the cycle or sound an alarm (i.e. low temperature alarm.)

There are a few reasons why an autoclave might not be able to reach the sterilization temperature within the given period of time. For example, perhaps the power source for the steam generator isn’t turned on. Certain autoclave models use integral steam generators, which sit below the autoclave chamber. This type of steam generator is typically hooked up to its own high-voltage power source, which can be turned off when the rest of the unit is still on. If the user doesn’t realize that the power source for the generator is turned off, while the rest of the sterilizer appears to be powered on, this would prevent the sterilizer from reaching the designated temperature.

Other reasons why the autoclave might not reach sterilization temperature include:

The steam generator is need of repair.

There is a clog in the chamber drain (i.e. check the chamber drain strainer) that is preventing air from escaping the chamber and the steam from reaching the correct pressure and temperature.

The temperature the user has entered exceeds the autoclave’s maximum temperature allowance.

2. The load is damaged by the autoclave.

There are a few ways that an autoclave can damage a load.

The first is melting. Autoclaves run at very high temperatures — temperatures that can melt certain materials, such as some plastics. Therefore, it’s important to ensure that any items loaded into a sterilizer are autoclave-safe. Fortunately, most laboratory equipment will either say whether it’s autoclave-safe or list its melting point. A melted load can damage a sterilizer, so it’s especially important to train autoclave users to be careful about what they load into the machine.

Another common issue is liquid loss, either in the form of evaporation or boil-over. The boiling temperature of water increases as pressure increases. For example, in order for steam to reach 121° C (250° F), autoclave pressure must increase to 14-16 PSI. If a cylinder or flask full of water is loaded into an autoclave and run at a temperature of 121° C, as soon as the cycle is completed the pressure is released, and water will start to boil over. This could cause splashing, which is a safety hazard; a smaller container could even explode. For laboratories that produce broth, evaporation or boil-over is money down the drain.

The best way to avoid this problem is to run a specialized Liquids Cycle that releases the chamber pressure slowly instead of all at once. This gives the liquids time to cool down, so it isn’t at its boiling point when the pressure is released. All Consolidated autoclaves are equipped with a Liquids Cycle.

Burned sugars are another common way for loads to be damaged by an autoclave. Much like liquids have a boiling point, sugars have a caramelization point. The best way to avoid this issue is to simultaneously increase the length of a sterilization cycle and decrease the temperature. For laboratories that handle extremely sensitive goods, Consolidated Sterilizer Systems offers a Low Temperature Cycle.

3. Goods are not sterilized.

Improperly sterilized goods can lead to contamination, growth in the media, or a failed Biological Indicator. The reasons a sterilizer may not sterilize the load are many: improper loading (e.g. covering the drain port, overpacking), steam dryness, component failure, insufficient steam, wrong cycle type, user error, etc. The best way to ensure proper sterilization is to validate the unit using a biological indicator (BI). In order to validate an autoclave, simply place the BI into a typical load. When the load is complete, take out the packet and put it in a special broth and incubate to see if there’s any growth. If there is no growth, it’s safe to assume that your load is validated to that cycle recipe and sterilization should occur. Please note: This paragraph is a very short over-simplification of the processes around validation and cycle development.

4. The load is wet after the sterilization cycle has ended — even with drying time.

This typically happens when autoclave users load porous goods such as cloth and paper close together, which causes them to act like a sponge and retain water. The easiest way to avoid this issue is to adopt a loading style that spaces out goods, such as a rack or cart-and-carriage arrangement. Another option is to invest in an autoclave with a vacuum capability, which dries goods at the end of the cycle. The sterilizer simply pulls the vacuum inside the chamber and evaporates any remaining water. You can read more about wet packs here.

5. A large liquid load causes the sterilization cycle to abort.

Large liquid loads take an exceptionally long time to heat, which can cause sterilization cycles to abort. Therefore, the best way to sterilize liquids is to space them out in as many small containers as possible. Another way to prevent this common autoclave problem is to use an F0 cycle, which enables the autoclave to count the time that it spends heating up the water toward the total sterilization time.

6. There’s no steam in the jacket.

Similar to the first item on this list, the easiest way to prevent this issue is to ensure that the power source for the steam generator is turned on. It’s also important to make sure that the steam line feeds into the autoclave correctly and to check the heating elements to see whether they’re damaged or broken.

7. Excessive amounts of water are going down the drain. No water is going down the drain, just steam.

Almost every autoclave has some sort of waste water cooling valve that opens and closes automatically in order to cool down the steam that’s coming out of the sterilizer before going down the drain. Both of the common autoclave problems mentioned above are caused by this valve being broken in some way.

Most autoclaves have an extra cold water line just before the drain with a temperature sensor. When that sensor detects steam, it adds a little water to it to cool down that steam. If that temperature sensor is broken or the valve is broken, it can cause the water to either dump out, which will make the autoclave sound like a sink all the time, or it could cause the steam to go down the drain if the valve is stuck closed.



Excessive water going down the drain is a clear indication that the valve is broken in the “open” position. Steam coming out of the drain is a sign that the valve is broken in the “closed” position, and that there’s no cooling water coming out of it.

Answer: If the inner lid of an autoclave gets stuck, it is important to ensure that the pressure inside the chamber has been completely released and that the pressure gauge indicates that the pressure has lowered to atmospheric levels. Once you have confirmed that the pressure is safe, you can proceed to open the lid. 

To avoid contaminating the inside contents, ensure that you are in a clean environment and that you are wearing appropriate protective gear, such as gloves. Carefully loosen the screw clamps and gently attempt to open the lid. If it remains stuck, do not force it open, as this could damage the autoclave or compromise the sterility of the contents. Instead, consult the autoclave's manual for troubleshooting steps or contact a qualified technician for assistance.

The following are the steps to be followed while running an autoclave:\\n\\nBefore beginning to use the autoclave, it should be checked for any items left from the previous cycle. A sufficient amount of water is then put inside the chamber. Now, the materials to be sterilized are placed inside the chamber. The lid is then closed, and the screws are tightened to ensure an airtight condition, and the electric heater is switched on. The safety valves are adjusted to maintain the required pressure in the chamber. Once the water inside the chamber boils, the air-water mixture is allowed to escape through the discharge tube to let all the air inside to be displaced. The complete displacement can be ensured once the water bubbles cease to come out from the pipe. The drainage pipe is then closed, and the steam inside is allowed to reach the desired levels (15 lbs in most cases). Once the pressure is reached, the whistle blows to remove excess pressure from the chamber. After the whistle, the autoclave is run for a holding period, which is 15 minutes in most cases. Now, the electric heater is switched off, and the autoclave is allowed to cool until the pressure gauge indicates the pressure inside has lowered down to that of the atmospheric pressure. The discharge pipe is then opened to allow the entry of air from the outside into the autoclave. Finally, the lid is opened, and the sterilized materials are taken out of the chamber.\\n\\nVideo: How to use an autoclave (BioNetwork)\\n\\nTypes of Autoclave\\n\\nThere are different types of autoclaves present in the market, some of which are:\\n\\nPressure cooker type/ Laboratory bench autoclaves (N-type)\\n\\nThese, as domestic pressure cookers, are still in use in many parts of the world.\\n\\nThe more modern type has a metal chamber with a secure metal lid that can be fastened and sealed with a rubber gasket.\\n\\nIt has an air and steam discharge tap, pressure gauge, and safety valve.

Answer: If the inner lid of an autoclave gets stuck, it is important to prioritize safety and avoid contaminating the contents. Here are some steps to follow:

1. **Ensure the Autoclave is Off and Cooled**: Make sure the autoclave is turned off and has cooled down to a safe temperature. The pressure inside should be equal to atmospheric pressure, as indicated by the pressure gauge.

2. **Check for Pressure Release**: Ensure that all pressure has been released from the chamber. This can be done by checking the pressure gauge and ensuring the whistle or pressure release valve has been activated.

3. **Avoid Forceful Opening**: Do not attempt to force the lid open. Forcing it can damage the autoclave or cause injury.

4. **Consult the Manual**: Refer to the autoclave's user manual for specific instructions on how to handle a stuck lid. There may be specific procedures or tools recommended by the manufacturer.

5. **Seek Professional Help**: If the lid remains stuck, contact a professional technician or the manufacturer for assistance. They can provide guidance or service the autoclave to safely open the lid.

By following these steps, you can ensure the safety of both the operator and the contents inside the autoclave.

 auxiliary). The problem does not arise in constructionist accounts, which do not assume movement.More generally, generativist and constructionist researchers agree about the basic thrust of the POS argument: the child cannot learn about the properties of empty categories, constraints on extraction, etc., from the input. What they disagree about is the conclusion that is to be drawn from this fact. For generative researchers, the fact that some grammatical principles or notions are unlearnable entails that they must be part of an innate UG. Constructionist researchers, on the other hand, draw a completely different conclusion: if X cannot be learned from the input, then we need a better linguistic theory—one that does not assume such an implausible construct.Thus, one of the basic principles of the constructionist approach is that linguists should focus on developing “child-friendly” grammars (Langacker, 1987, 1991, 2008; Goldberg, 2003; Tomasello, 2003, 2006; Dąbrowska, 2004)
Answer: As a scientist belonging to the construction grammarians camp, I would present the following counterarguments to refute the generativistic approach:

1. **Unlearnable Constructs**: Constructionists argue that if certain grammatical principles or notions are unlearnable from the input, it suggests the need for a better linguistic theory rather than assuming these constructs are part of an innate Universal Grammar (UG). The focus should be on developing theories that do not rely on implausible constructs that cannot be learned from the input.

2. **Child-Friendly Grammars**: Constructionists emphasize the importance of creating "child-friendly" grammars. This approach suggests that linguistic theories should be grounded in the actual learning processes of children, rather than assuming the existence of innate grammatical knowledge that is not evident in the input.

3. **Empirical Focus**: Constructionists advocate for an empirical focus on the data available to children and how they use this data to construct their understanding of language. This contrasts with the generativist reliance on theoretical constructs that may not be directly observable or learnable from the input.

4. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Constructionist theories are often more flexible and adaptable to the variability and diversity observed in language learning across different languages and cultures. This adaptability challenges the notion of a fixed, innate UG that applies universally.

5. **Cognitive and Social Factors**: Constructionists highlight the role of cognitive and social factors in language learning, suggesting that these factors can account for the acquisition of complex grammatical structures without the need for innate grammatical knowledge.

By focusing on these points, construction grammarians argue for a linguistic theory that is more aligned with the observable processes of language acquisition and the variability of linguistic input.

Answer: To refute the generativistic approach, a construction grammarian might present the following counterarguments:

1. **Usage-Based Model**: Construction grammarians argue that language is learned through usage and exposure, rather than an innate set of grammatical rules. They emphasize the importance of frequency and context in language acquisition, suggesting that linguistic knowledge is built from specific instances of language use.

2. **Constructions as Fundamental Units**: Instead of viewing language as a set of abstract rules, construction grammarians see it as a collection of constructions—form-meaning pairings that range from simple words to complex sentence patterns. This challenges the generativist idea of a universal grammar.

3. **Flexibility and Variation**: Construction grammar accounts for the variability and flexibility of language, highlighting how speakers can create novel expressions by manipulating existing constructions. This adaptability is often underrepresented in generative models, which focus on fixed syntactic structures.

4. **Empirical Evidence**: Construction grammarians often rely on empirical data from real language use, including corpus studies and psycholinguistic experiments, to support their claims. They argue that generative grammar sometimes lacks empirical grounding, relying more on theoretical constructs.

5. **Cognitive and Social Factors**: Construction grammar integrates cognitive and social aspects of language, emphasizing how language is shaped by human cognition and social interaction. This contrasts with the generativist focus on syntax and abstract rule systems.

By presenting these arguments, construction grammarians aim to provide a more comprehensive and empirically grounded understanding of language that challenges the generativist perspective.

It may also be different than another HER2-positive patient’s therapy. Each cancer is unique, so doctors try to develop the treatment course that’s best for you. Things to consider include the size of your tumor, whether the cancer has metastasized (spread), or your overall risk of recurrence.

Treatments You May Consider The most common treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer is chemotherapy plus HER2-directed therapy. This is followed by surgery, then continues with HER2-directed therapy. This is often best for patients with large tumors or cancer in regional lymph nodes.

For targeted therapy, your doctor may recommend a family of drugs commonly known as monoclonal antibodies. This includes trastuzumab (Herceptin), the first-in-its-class precision therapy drug approved by the FDA for HER2+ breast cancer. It’s less common, but you may have surgery first, followed by chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapy. Your doctor may choose this sequence if you have a small tumor that isn’t in your lymph nodes. Your doctor may also recommend endocrine therapy. This treatment involves taking a daily pill for at least 5 years after you complete chemotherapy and surgery.
Treatment for early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer will likely include some combination of surgery, targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and possibly other therapies. What’s right for you will depend on your wants and needs. There are three typical treatment strategies:

When your health care team talks about your HER2+ breast cancer treatment, they may use terms you don’t know. These are some common ones and what they mean.

About one in five people with breast cancer have the HER2+ subtype. If your breast cancer is of the HER2+ subtype, your tumor has high levels of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 plays a role in the growth of cancer cells, which is why HER2+ breast cancer tends to be aggressive.

An early-stage HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is always a shock, but today’s treatment options should give you hope. Over the past 2 decades, advances in medicine have brought us new, effective therapies.

Targeted Therapy: Herceptin Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was the first targeted therapy approved by the FDA for HER2+ breast cancer. It’s a type of biologic drug called a monoclonal antibody. Trastuzumab is given intravenously (with an IV) weekly or every 3 weeks. As an adjuvant therapy, one year of treatment of treatment is typical. Multiple studies show that trastuzumab can dramatically improve survival. In fact, trastuzumab-based treatments for HER2+ breast cancer are considered the gold standard. The main downside is cost. Without insurance, a year of trastuzumab could set you back at least $70,000.

Targeted Therapy: Herceptin Biosimilars Generic drugs don’t exist for brand-name biologics. Biologics are made of large, complex molecules and produced -- thanks to the magic of biotechnology -- in a living system, such as an animal or plant cell. You can’t replicate that. But you can create a similar version. These drugs are called biosimilars. They have “no clinically meaningful differences” in terms of safety, purity, or potency. Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase (Herceptin Hylecta) is another type of trastuzumab treatment that is injected underneath the skin.

Targeted Therapy: Perjeta Pertuzumab (Perjeta) treats HER2-positive early breast cancer, usually in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. It’s FDA-approved for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment. Neoadjuvant use: For people with HER2+ breast cancer that is locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage.

For people with HER2+ breast cancer that is locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage. Adjuvant use: For people with HER2+ early breast cancer that’s highly likely to come back. For people who are receiving a combination of targeted therapy, the drug trastuzumab, pertuzumab and hyaluronidase (Phesgo) may be given as a shot under the skin.

Targeted Therapy: Kinase Inhibitors Kinase inhibitors block the action of HER2 and other kinase proteins that help cancer cells grow. Neratinib (Nerlynx) is a kinase inhibitor used to treat HER2-positive early breast cancer after receiving a year of trastuzumab. It is a pill that is taken daily.
Answer: For a patient with a history of heart failure and newly diagnosed metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, the recommended first line of treatment would typically involve HER2-directed therapy, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin), in combination with chemotherapy. However, given the patient's history of heart failure, it is crucial to discuss the potential cardiotoxicity associated with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab can have cardiac side effects, including heart failure, which is particularly relevant for this patient.

Additional information that should be discussed with the patient includes:

1. **Cardiac Monitoring**: The importance of regular cardiac monitoring during treatment to assess heart function and detect any early signs of cardiac issues.

2. **Alternative Treatment Options**: Exploring alternative HER2-directed therapies or treatment regimens that may have a lower risk of cardiotoxicity, if necessary.

3. **Risk-Benefit Analysis**: A thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of using trastuzumab in the context of her existing heart condition, and how it might impact her overall treatment plan.

4. **Collaboration with a Cardiologist**: Involving a cardiologist in the treatment planning to manage and monitor her heart condition alongside cancer treatment.

5. **Lifestyle and Supportive Measures**: Recommendations for lifestyle changes or supportive measures that could help mitigate cardiac risks during treatment.

The treatment plan should be personalized, taking into account the patient's specific medical history, current health status, and preferences.

Answer: The context provided does not directly address the treatment of metastatic HER2+ breast cancer in a patient with a history of heart failure. However, generally, the first-line treatment for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer often includes targeted therapies such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) and pertuzumab, usually in combination with chemotherapy. Given the patient's history of heart failure, it is crucial to discuss the potential cardiotoxicity associated with HER2-targeted therapies, particularly trastuzumab, as it can exacerbate heart failure. Close monitoring of cardiac function, possibly with regular echocardiograms, and collaboration with a cardiologist would be important aspects of her treatment plan. Additionally, alternative treatment options with less cardiotoxicity might be considered based on the severity of her heart failure.

Feminism comprises a number of social, cultural and political movements, theories and moral philosophies concerned with gender inequalities and equal rights for women. The term “feminism” originated from the French word “feminisme,” coined by the utopian socialist Charles Fourier, and was first used in English in the 1890s, in association with the movement for equal political and legal rights for women. Feminism takes a number of forms in a variety of disciplines such as feminist geography, feminist history and feminist literary criticism. Feminism has changed aspects of Western society. Feminist political activists have been concerned with issues such as individual autonomy, political rights, social freedom, economic independence, abortion and reproductive rights, divorce, workplace rights (including maternity leave and equal pay), and education; and putting an end to domestic violence, gender stereotypes, discrimination, sexism, objectification, and prostitution.

Historians of feminism have identified three “waves” of feminist thought and activity. The first wave, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, focused primarily on gaining legal rights, political power and suffrage for women. The second, in the 1960s and 1970s, encouraged women to understand aspects of their own personal lives as deeply politicized, and was largely concerned with other issues of equality, such as the end to discrimination in society, in education and in the work place. The third arose in the early 1990s as a response to perceived failures of the second-wave, and a response to the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second-wave. Throughout most of its history, most leaders of feminist social and political movements, and feminist theorists, have been middle-class white women, predominantly in Britain, France and the US. At least since Sojourner Truth's 1851 speech to US feminists, however, women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms, and women in former European colonies and the Third World have proposed alternative "post-colonial" and "Third World" feminisms.

History of Feminism

Feminism comprises a number of social, cultural and political movements, theories and moral philosophies concerned with gender inequalities and equal rights for women. In its narrowest interpretation, it refers to the effort to ensure legal and political equality for women; in its broadest sense it comprises any theory which is grounded on the belief that women are oppressed or disadvantaged by comparison with men, and that their oppression is in some way illegitimate or unjustified.

The term “feminism” originated from the French word “feminisme,” coined by the utopian socialist Charles Fourier, and was first used in English in the 1890s, in association with the movement for equal political and legal rights for women. There is some debate as to whether the term “feminism” can be appropriately applied to the thought and activities of earlier women (and men) who explored and challenged the traditional roles of women in society.

Contemporary feminist historians distinguish three “waves” in the history of feminism. The first-wave refers to the feminism movement of the nineteenth through early twentieth centuries, which dealt mainly with the Suffrage movement. The second-wave (1960s-1980s) dealt with the inequality of laws, as well as cultural inequalities. The third-wave of Feminism (1990s-present), is seen as both a continuation of and a response to the perceived failures of the second-wave.

First-wave feminism

First-wave feminism refers to a period of feminist activity during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century in the United Kingdom and the United States. Originally it focused on equal legal rights of contract and property, and opposition to chattel marriage and ownership of married women (and their children) by husbands. A Vindication of the Rights of Women, written by Mary Wollstonecraft in 1742, is considered a germinal essay of feminism. Wollstonecraft protested against the stereotyping of women in domestic roles, the failure to regard women as individuals in their own right, and the failure to educate girls and women to use their intellect.

By the end of the nineteenth century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power and women's suffrage, though feminists like Voltairine de Cleyre (1866 – 1912) and Margaret Sanger (1879 – 1966) were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive and economic rights. In Britain the Suffragettes campaigned for the women's vote. In 1918 the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed, granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned houses. In 1928 this was extended to all women over eighteen.

In the United States leaders of this movement include Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery prior to championing women's right to vote. Other important leaders included Lucy Stone, Olympia Brown, and Helen Pitts. American first-wave feminism involved women from a wide range of backgrounds, some belonging to conservative Christian groups (such as Frances Willard and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union), others representing the diversity and radicalism of much of second-wave feminism (such as Stanton, Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage and the National Woman Suffrage Association, of which Stanton was president).

In the United States first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1919), granting women the right to vote.

Second-wave feminism

“Second-wave feminism” refers to a period of feminist activity beginning in the early 1960s and lasting through the late 1980s. It was a continuation of the earlier phase of feminism which sought legal and political rights in the United Kingdom and the United States. Second-wave feminism has existed continuously since then, and coexists with what is termed “third-wave feminism.” Second-wave feminism saw cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked. The movement encouraged women to understand aspects of their own personal lives as deeply politicized, and reflective of a gender-biased structure of power. While first-wave feminism focused upon absolute rights such as suffrage, second-wave feminism was largely concerned with other issues of equality, such as the end to gender discrimination in society, in education and in the workplace. The title of an essay by Carol Hanisch, "The Personal is Political," became a slogan synonymous with second-wave feminism and the women's liberation movement.

Women's liberation in the USA

The term “Women’s Liberation” was first used in 1964 and first appeared in print in 1966. By 1968, although the term “Women’s Liberation Front” appeared in “Ramparts,” the term “women’s liberation” was being used to refer to the whole women’s movement. Although no burning took place, a number of feminine products including bras were thrown into a "Freedom Trash Can," the term "bra-burning" became associated with the movement.[10]

The Feminine Mystique, published in 1963 by Betty Friedan, criticized the idea that women could only find fulfillment through childbearing and homemaking. According to Friedan's obituary in the The New York Times The Feminine Mystique “ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world” and “is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.”[11] Friedan hypothesized that women are victims of a false belief system that requires them to find identity and meaning in their lives through their husbands and children. Such a system causes women to completely lose their identity in that of their family. Friedan specifically located this system among post-World War II middle-class suburban communities. She pointed out that though America's post-war economic boom had led to the development of new technologies that were supposed to make household work less difficult, they often had the result of making women's work less meaningful and valuable. She also critiqued Freud's theory that women were envious of men. Friedan’s book played an important role in encouraging women to question traditional female roles and seek self-fulfillment.[12]

Third-wave feminism

Third-wave feminism has its origins in the mid 1980s, with feminist leaders rooted in the second-wave like Gloria Anzaldua, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherrie Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and other black feminists, who sought to negotiate prominent space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities.[13]

The third-wave of feminism arose in the early 1990s as a response to perceived failures of the second-wave, and a response to the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second-wave. Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid what it deems the second-wave's "essentialist" definitions of femininity, claiming that these definitions over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle class white women and largely ignored the circumstances of lower-class women, minorities and women living in other cultures. A post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality is central to much of the third-wave's ideology. Third-wave feminists often focus on "micropolitics," and challenge the second-wave's paradigm as to what is, or is not, good for females.[14]

In 1991, Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas, a man nominated to the United States Supreme Court, of sexual harassment. Thomas denied the accusations and after extensive debate, the US Senate voted 52-48 in favor of Thomas.[13] In response to this case, Rebecca Walker published an article entitled "Becoming the Third Wave" in which she stated, "I am not a post-feminism feminist. I am the third-wave."

Contemporary feminism

Contemporary feminism comprises a number of different philosophical strands. These movements sometimes disagree about current issues and how to confront them. One side of the spectrum includes a number of radical feminists, such as Mary Daly, who argue that society would benefit if there were dramatically fewer men.[15] Other figures such as Christina Hoff Sommers and Camille Paglia identify themselves as feminist but accuse the movement of anti-male prejudice.[16]

Some feminists, like Katha Pollitt, author of Reasonable Creatures, or Nadine Strossen, consider feminism to hold simply that "women are people." Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be sexist rather than feminist.[17] There are also debates between difference feminists such as Carol Gilligan, who believe that there are important differences between the sexes, which may or may not be inherent, but which cannot be ignored; and those who believe that there are no essential differences between the sexes, and that their societal roles are due to conditioning.[18] Individualist feminists such as Wendy McElroy are concerned with equality of rights, and criticize sexist/classist forms of feminism as "gender feminism."

French feminism

Feminism in France originated during the French Revolution, with the organization of several associations such as the Société fraternelle de l'un et l'autre sexe (Fraternal Society of one and the other Sex), the Société des républicaines révolutionnaires (Society of Revolutionary Republicans—the final "e" implicitly referring to Republican Women), which boasted 200 exclusively female members. The feminist movement developed itself again in Socialist movements of the Romantic generation, in particular among Parisian Saint-Simonians. Women freely adopted new life-styles, often arousing public indignation. They claimed equality of rights and participated in the production of an abundant literature exploring freedom for women. Charles Fourier's Utopian Socialist theory of passions advocated "free love," and his architectural model of the phalanstère community explicitly took into account women's emancipation. A few famous figures emerged during the 1871 Paris Commune, including Louise Michel, Russian-born Elisabeth Dmitrieff, Nathalie Lemel and Renée Vivien.

Simone de Beauvoir

Simone de Beauvoir, a French author and philosopher who wrote on philosophy, politics, and social issues, published a treatise in 1949, The Second Sex, a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism. It set out a feminist existentialism which prescribed a moral revolution. As an existentialist, de Beauvoir accepted the precept that "existence precedes essence"; hence "one is not born a woman, but becomes one." Her analysis focused on the social construction of Woman as the quintessential “Other” as fundamental to women's oppression.[19] She argued that women have historically been considered deviant and abnormal, and that even Mary Wollstonecraft had considered men to be the ideal toward which women should aspire. According to Beauvoir, this attitude had limited women's success by maintaining the perception that they are a deviation from the normal, and are outsiders attempting to emulate "normality." [19]

1970s until the present

French feminists have a tendency to attack the rationalist Enlightenment thinking which first accorded them intellectual freedom as being itself male-oriented, and approach feminism with the concept of écriture féminine (female, or feminine, writing). Helene Cixous argues that traditional writing and philosophy are 'phallocentric,' and along with other French feminists such as Luce Irigaray, emphasizes "writing from the body" as a subversive exercise.[20] Another theorist working in France (but originally from Bulgaria) is Julia Kristeva, whose work on the semiotic and abjection has influenced feminist criticism. However, according to Elizabeth Wright, "none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the Anglophone world."[20]

Indian feminism

With the rise of a new wave of feminism across the world, a new generation of Indian feminists emerged. Increasing numbers of highly-educated and professional Indian women have entered the public arena in fields such as politics, business and scientific research. Contemporary Indian feminists are fighting for individual autonomy, political rights, social freedom, economic independence, tolerance, co-operation, nonviolence and diversity, abortion and reproductive rights, divorce, equal pay, education, maternity leave, breast feeding; and an end to domestic violence, gender stereotypes, discrimination, sexism, objectification, and prostitution. Medha Patkar, Madhu Kishwar, and Brinda Karat are some of the feminist social workers and politicians who advocate women's rights in post-independent India. In literature, Amrita Pritam, Sarojini Sahoo and Kusum Ansal are eminent Indian writers (in Indian languages) who link sexuality with feminism, and advocate women's rights. Rajeshwari Sunder Rajan, Leela Kasturi, Sharmila Rege, Vidyut Bhagat are some of the essayists and social critics who write in favor of feminism in English.

Feminist Theory

Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical, or philosophical, fields. It encompasses work in a variety of disciplines, including approaches to women's roles and life experiences; feminist politics in anthropology and sociology, economics, women's studies; gender studies; feminist literary criticism; and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations and sexuality. While providing a critique of social relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on analyzing gender inequalities and on the promotion of women's rights, interests, and issues. Themes explored in feminism include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.[21]

Elaine Showalter describes the development of feminist theory as having a number of phases. The first she calls "feminist critique" - where the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls "Gynocritics" - where the "woman is producer of textual meaning" including "the psychodynamics of female creativity; linguistics and the problem of a female language; the trajectory of the individual or collective female literary career [and] literary history." The last phase she calls "gender theory" - where the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system" are explored."[22] This model has been criticized by Toril Moi who sees it as an essentialist and deterministic model for female subjectivity. She also criticized it for not taking account of the situation for women outside the west.[23]

Feminism's Many Forms

Several subtypes of feminist ideology have developed over the years; some of the major subtypes are listed as follows:



Liberal feminism

Liberal feminism asserts the equality of men and women through political and legal reform. It is an individualistic form of feminism and feminist theory, which focuses on women’s ability to show and maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. Liberal feminism looks at the personal interactions between men and women as the starting ground from which to introduce gender-equity into society. According to liberal feminists, all women are capable of asserting their ability to achieve equality; therefore it is possible for change to come about without altering the structure of society. Issues important to liberal feminists include reproductive and abortion rights, sexual harassment, voting, education, "equal pay for equal work," affordable childcare, affordable health care, and bringing to light the frequency of sexual and domestic violence against women.[24]

Radical feminism

Radical feminism identifies the capitalist sexist hierarchy as the defining feature of women’s oppression. Radical feminists believe that women can free themselves only when they have done away with what they consider an inherently oppressive and dominating system. Radical feminists feel that male-based authority and power structures are responsible for oppression and inequality, and that as long as the system and its values are in place, society will not be able to reform in any significant way. Radical feminism sees capitalism as a barrier to ending oppression. Most radical feminists see no alternatives other than the total uprooting and reconstruction of society in order to achieve their goals.

Separatist feminism is a form of radical feminism that rejects heterosexual relationships, believing that the sexual disparities between men and women are unresolvable. Separatist feminists generally do not feel that men can make positive contributions to the feminist movement, and that even well-intentioned men replicate the dynamics of patriarchy. Author Marilyn Frye describes separatist feminism as "separation of various sorts or modes from men and from institutions, relationships, roles and activities that are male-defined, male-dominated, and operating for the benefit of males and the maintenance of male privilege—this separation being initiated or maintained, at will, by women."[25]

Both the self-proclaimed sex-positive and the so-called sex-negative forms of present-day feminism can trace their roots to early radical feminism. Ellen Willis's 1981 essay, "Lust Horizons: Is the Women's Movement Pro-Sex?" is the origin of the term, "pro-sex feminism." In it, she argues against feminism making alliances with the political right in opposition to pornography and prostitution, as occurred, for example, during the Meese Commission hearings in the United States.[26]

Another strand of radical feminism is "Anarcha-feminism" (also called anarchist feminism or anarcho-feminism). It combines feminist ideas and anarchist beliefs. Anarcha-feminists view patriarchy as a manifestation of hierarchy, believing that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state.[27] Anarcha-feminists like Susan Brown see the anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle, in Brown's words "anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist."[28]Wendy McElroy has defined a position (she describes it as "ifeminism" or "individualist feminism") that combines feminism with anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism, arguing that a pro-capitalist, anti-state position is compatible with an emphasis on equal rights and empowerment for women.[29]

Individualist feminism

Individualist feminists define "Individualist feminism" in opposition to political or gender feminism.[30] It is closely linked to the libertarian ideas of individuality and personal responsibility of both women and men. Critics believe that individual feminism reinforces patriarchal systems because it does not view the rights or political interests of men and women as being in conflict, nor does it rest upon class/gender analysis.[31] Individualist feminists attempt to change legal systems in order to eliminate class privileges, including gender privileges, and to ensure that individuals have an equal right, an equal claim under law to their own persons and property. Individualist feminism encourages women to take full responsibility over their own lives. It also opposes any government interference into the choices adults make with their own bodies, contending that such interference creates a coercive hierarchy.[30]

Black feminism

Angela Davis speaking at the University of Alberta, March 28, 2006

Black feminism argues that sexism and racism are inextricable from one another.[32] Forms of feminism that strive to overcome sexism and class oppression but ignore race can discriminate against many people, including women, through racial bias. Black feminists argue that the liberation of black women entails freedom for all people, since it would require the end of racism, sexism, and class oppression.[33]

One of the theories that evolved out of this movement was Alice Walker's Womanism which emerged after the early feminist movements that were led specifically by white women who advocated social changes such as woman’s suffrage. These movements were largely a white middle-class movements and ignored oppression based on racism and classism. Alice Walker and other Womanists pointed out that black women experienced a different and more intense kind of oppression from that of white women.[34]

Angela Davis was one of the first people who formed an argument centered on intersection of race, gender and class in her book, Women, Race, and Class.[35] Kimberle Crenshaw, prominent feminist law theorist, gave the idea a name while discussing Identity Politics.[36]

Socialist and Marxist feminisms

Socialist feminism connects the oppression of women to Marxist ideas about exploitation, oppression and labor. Socialist feminists see women as being held down as a result of their unequal standing in both the workplace and the domestic sphere. Prostitution, domestic work, childcare, and marriage are all seen as ways in which women are exploited by a patriarchal system which devalues women and the substantial work that they do. Socialist feminists focus their energies on broad change that affects society as a whole, and not just on an individual basis. They see the need to work alongside not just men, but all other groups, as they see the oppression of women as a part of a larger pattern that affects everyone involved in the capitalist system.[37]

Karl Marx taught that when class oppression was overcome, gender oppression would vanish as well. According to socialist feminists, this view of gender oppression as a sub-class of class oppression is naive, and much of the work of socialist feminists has gone towards separating gender phenomena from class phenomena. Some contributors to socialist feminism have criticized traditional Marxist ideas for being largely silent on gender oppression except to subsume it underneath broader class oppression.[38] Other socialist feminists, notably two long-lived American organizations Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party, point to the classic Marxist writings of Friedrich Engels[39] and August Bebel[40] as a powerful explanation of the link between gender oppression and class exploitation.

In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century both Clara Zetkin and Eleanor Marx were against the demonization of men and supported a proletarian revolution that would overcome as many male-female inequalities as possible.[41]

Post-structural and postmodern feminism

Post-structural feminists, also referred to as French feminists, use the insights of various epistemological movements, including psychoanalysis, linguistics, political theory (Marxist and neo-Marxist theory), race theory, literary theory, and other intellectual currents to explore and define feminist concerns.[42] Many post-structural feminists maintain that difference is one of the most powerful tools that females possess in their struggle with patriarchal domination, and that to equate feminist movement only with gender equality is to deny women a plethora of options, as "equality" is still defined within a masculine or patriarchal perspective.[43]

Judith Butler at a lecture at the University of Hamburg.

Postmodern feminism is an approach to feminist theory that incorporates postmodern and post-structuralist theory. The largest departure from other branches of feminism, is the argument that sex as well as gender is constructed through language.[44] The most notable proponent of this argument is Judith Butler, in her 1990 book, Gender Trouble, which draws on, and criticizes the work of Simone de Beauvoir, Michel Foucault and Jacques Lacan. Butler criticizes the distinction drawn by previous feminisms between (biological) sex and socially constructed gender. She says that this does not allow for a sufficient criticism of essentialism (the concept that certain qualities or characteristics are essential to the definition of gender). For Butler "women" and "woman" are fraught categories, complicated by class, ethnicity, sexuality, and other facets of identity. She suggests that gender is performative. This argument leads to the conclusion that there is no single cause for women's subordination, and no single approach towards dealing with the issue.[44]

A Cyborg Manifesto, with her dog Cayenne Donna Haraway, author ofwith her dog Cayenne

In A Cyborg Manifesto Donna Haraway criticizes traditional notions of feminism, particularly its emphasis on identity, rather than affinity. She uses the metaphor of a cyborg (an organism that is a self-regulating integration of artificial and natural systems) in order to construct a postmodern feminism that moves beyond dualisms and the limitations of traditional gender, feminism, and politics.[45] Haraway's cyborg is an attempt to break away from Oedipal narratives and Christian origins doctrines like Genesis: "The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust."[45]

Other postmodern feminist works emphasizes stereotypical female roles, only to portray them as parodies of the original beliefs. The history of feminism is not important to them, their only concern is what is going to be done about it. In fact, the history of feminism is dismissed and used to depict better how ridiculous the past beliefs were. Modern feminist theory has been extensively criticized as being predominantly, though not exclusively, associated with western middle class academia. Mainstream feminism has been criticized as being too narrowly focused, and inattentive to related issues of race and class.[46]

Postcolonial and third-world feminism

Since the 1980s, standpoint feminists have argued that the feminist movement should address global issues (such as rape, incest, and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as female genital mutilation in some parts of Africa and the Middle East and glass ceiling practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, colonialism, and classism in a "matrix of domination."[47] Postcolonial and third world feminists argue that some cultural and class issues must be understood in the context of other political and social needs which may take precedence for women in developing and third world countries.

Postcolonial feminism emerged from the gendered history of colonialism. Colonial powers often imposed Western norms on the regions they colonized. In the 1940s and 1950s, after the formation of the United Nations, former colonies were monitored by the West for what was considered "social progress." The status of women in the developing world has been monitored and evaluated by organizations such as the United Nations, according to essentially Western standards. Traditional practices and roles taken up by women, sometimes seen as distasteful by Western standards, could be considered a form of rebellion against the gender roles imposed by colonial powers.[48] Postcolonial feminists today struggle to fight gender oppression within their own cultural models of society, rather than those imposed by the Western colonizers.[49]

Postcolonial feminists argue that racial, class, and ethnic oppressions relating to the colonial experience have marginalized women in postcolonial societies. They challenge the assumption that gender oppression is the primary force of patriarchy. Postcolonial feminists object to portrayals of women of non-Western societies as passive and voiceless victims, as opposed to the portrayal of Western women as modern, educated and empowered.[50]

Postcolonial feminism is critical of Western forms of feminism, notably radical feminism and liberal feminism and their universalization of female experience. Postcolonial feminists argue that, in cultures impacted by colonialism, the glorification of a pre-colonial culture, in which power was stratified along lines of gender, could include the acceptance of, or refusal to deal with, inherent issues of gender inequality. Postcolonial feminists can be described as feminists who have reacted against both universalizing tendencies in Western feminist thought and a lack of attention to gender issues in mainstream postcolonial thought[50]

Third-world feminism has been described as a group of feminist theories developed by feminists who acquired their views and took part in feminist politics in so-called third world countries[51] Although women from the third world have been engaged in the feminist movement, Chandra Talpade Mohanty criticizes Western feminism on the grounds that it is ethnocentric and does not take into account the unique experiences of women from third world countries or the existence of feminisms indigenous to third world countries. According to her, women in the third world feel that Western feminism bases its understanding of women on its "internal racism, classism and homophobia."[52] This discourse is strongly related to African feminism and postcolonial feminism. Its development is also associated with concepts such as black feminism, womanism,[13] "motherism,"[53] "Stiwanism,"[54] "negofeminism," chicana feminism, and "femalism."

Ecofeminism

Vandana Shiva 2007 in Cologne, Germany

Ecofeminism links ecology with feminism. Ecofeminists see the domination of women as stemming from the same ideologies that bring about the domination of the environment. Patriarchal systems, where men own and control the land, are seen as responsible for both the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment. Since the men in power control the land, they are able to exploit it for their own profit and success, in the same sense that women are exploited by men in power for their own profit, success, and pleasure. As a way of repairing social and ecological injustices, ecofeminists feel that women must work towards creating a healthy environment and ending the destruction of the lands that most women rely on to provide for their families.[55]

Ecofeminism argues that there is a connection between women and nature that comes from their shared history of oppression by a patriarchal western society. Vandana Shiva explains how women's special connection to the environment through their daily interactions with it have been ignored. She says that "women in subsistence economies, producing and reproducing wealth in partnership with nature, have been experts in their own right of holistic and ecological knowledge of nature’s processes. But these alternative modes of knowing, which are oriented to the social benefits and sustenance needs are not recognized by the [capitalist] reductionist paradigm, because it fails to perceive the interconnectedness of nature, or the connection of women’s lives, work and knowledge with the creation of wealth.”[56] Ecofeminists also criticize Western lifestyle choices, such as consuming food that has traveled thousands of miles and playing sports (such as golf and bobsledding) which inherently require ecological destruction.

Feminist and social ecologist Janet Biehl has criticized ecofeminism for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature, and not enough on the actual conditions of women.[57]

Post-feminism

The term 'post-feminism' comprises a wide range of theories, some of which argue that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.[58] One of the earliest uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin's 1982 article "Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation," published in New York Times Magazine. This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify themselves as feminists.[59] Post-feminism takes a critical approach to previous feminist discourses, including challenges to second-wave ideas.[20]

Sarah Gamble argues that feminists such as Naomi Wolf, Katie Roiphe, Natasha Walter and Rene Denfeld are labeled as 'anti-feminists,' whereas they define themselves as feminists who have shifted from second-wave ideas towards an "individualistic liberal agenda".[60] Denfeld has distanced herself from feminists who see pornography and heterosexuality as oppressive and also criticized what she sees as, the second-wave's "reckless" use of the term patriarchy.[61] Gamble points out that post-feminists like Denfeld are criticized as "pawns of a conservative 'backlash' against feminism."[60]

Issues in Defining Feminism

One of the difficulties in defining and circumscribing a complex and heterogeneous concept such as feminism is the extent to which women have rejected the term from a variety of semantic and political standpoints. Many women engaged in activities intimately grounded in feminism have not considered themselves feminists. It is assumed that only women can be feminists. However, feminism is not grounded in a person's gender, but in their commitment to rejecting and refuting sexist oppression politically, socially, privately, linguistically, and otherwise. Defining feminism in this way reflects the contemporary reality that both men and women openly support feminism, and also openly adhere to sexist ideals.[62]

Politically, use of the term "feminism" has been rejected both because of fears of labeling, and because of its innate ability to attract broad misogyny.[63]Virginia Woolf was one of the more prominent women to reject the term early in its history in 1938,[64] although she is regarded as an icon of feminism.[65] Betty Friedan revisited this concern in 1981 in The Second Stage.[66]

Ann Taylor offered the following definition of a feminist:

Any person who recognizes "the validity of women's own interpretation of their lived experiences and needs," protests against the institutionalized injustice perpetrated by men as a group against women as a group, and advocates the elimination of that injustice by challenging the various structures of authority or power that legitimate male prerogatives in a given society.[67]

Another way of expressing this concept is that a primary goal of feminism is to correct androcentric bias.[68]

However, one of feminism's unique characteristics is its persistent defiance of being constrained by definition:

The multiple and contrary readings of the philosophical canon by feminists reflects the contested nature of the “us” of contemporary feminism. The fact that feminist interpretations of canonical figures is diverse reflects, and is a part of, on-going debates within feminism over its identity and self-image. Disagreements among feminist historians of philosophy over the value of canonical philosophers, and the appropriate categories to use to interpret them, are, in the final analysis, the result of debate within feminist philosophy over what feminism is, and what is theoretical commitments should be, and what its core values are.[69]

Some contemporary women and men have distanced themselves from the term "femin"ism in favor of more inclusive terminology such as "equal rights activist/advocate," "equalist" or similar non-gendered phrasings.

Feminism and Society



Woman Suffrage Headquarters, Cleveland, 1912 By campaigning for the right to vote, suffragettes began the feminist struggle for equality in the West.

The feminist movement has effected a number of changes in Western society, including women's suffrage; the right to initiate divorce proceedings and "no fault" divorce; access to university education; and the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion).[70]

Language

Gender-neutral language is the usage of terminology which is aimed at minimizing assumptions regarding the biological sex of human referents. Gender-neutral language is advocated both by those who aim to clarify the inclusion of both sexes or genders (gender-inclusive language); and by those who propose that gender, as a category, is rarely worth marking in language (gender-neutral language). Gender-neutral language is sometimes described as non-sexist language by advocates, and politically-correct language by opponents.

Heterosexual relationships

The increased entry of women into the workplace which began during the Industrial Revolution and increased rapidly during the twentieth and century has affected gender roles and the division of labor within households. The sociologist, Arlie Russell Hochschild, presents evidence in her books, The Second Shift and The Time Bind, that in two-career couples, men and women on the average spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework.[71][72]

Feminist criticisms of men's contributions to child care and domestic labor in the Western middle class are typically centered around the idea that it is unfair for women to be expected to perform more than half of a household's domestic work and child care when both members of the relationship also work outside the home. Feminism has affected women’s choices to bear a child, both in and out of wedlock, by making the choice less dependent on the financial and social support of a male partner.[73]

Religion

Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of their religion from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.[74]

Christian feminism

Christian feminism is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in terms of the equality of women and men morally, socially, and in leadership. Because this equality has been historically ignored, Christian feminists believe their contributions are necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of biologically-determined characteristics such as gender. Their major issues are the ordination of women, male dominance in Christian marriage, and claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of the abilities of women compared to men. They also are concerned with issues such as the balance of parenting between mothers and fathers and the overall treatment of women in the church.[75]

Jewish feminism

Jewish feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of Judaism. In its modern form, the movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the United States. According to Judith Plaskow, who has focused on feminism in Reform Judaism, the main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot (coming of age ceremony), and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce.[76]

Islamic feminism

Mukhtaran Bibi, Glamour Magazine Woman of the Year 2005

Islamic feminism is concerned with the role of women in Islam. It aims for the full equality of all Muslims, regardless of gender, in public and private life. Islamic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equality, and social justice grounded in an Islamic framework. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement. Advocates of the movement seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Qur'an and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Qur'an (holy book), hadith (sayings of Muhammed) and sharia (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.

Scientific Research into Feminist Issues

Some natural and social scientists have considered feminist ideas and feminist forms of scholarship using scientific methods.

One core scientific controversy involves the issue of the social construction versus the biological formation of gender- or sex-associated identities. Modern feminist science examines the view that most, if not all, differences between the sexes are based on socially constructed gender identities rather than on biological sex differences. Anne Fausto-Sterling's book Myths of Gender explores the assumptions, embodied in scientific research, that purport to support a biologically essentialist view of gender.[77] In The Female Brain, Louann Brizendine argues that brain differences between the sexes are a biological reality, with significant implications for sex-specific functional differences.[78] Steven Rhoads' book Taking Sex Differences Seriously, illustrates sex-dependent differences in a variety of areas.[79]

Carol Tavris, in The Mismeasure of Woman (the title is a play on Stephen Jay Gould's The Mismeasure of Man), uses psychology, sociology, and analysis in a critique of theories that use biological reductionism to explain differences between men and women. She argues that such theories, rather being based on an objective analysis of the evidence of innate gender difference, have grown out of an over-arching hypothesis intended to justify inequality and perpetuate stereotypes.[80]

Sarah Kember, drawing from numerous areas such as evolutionary biology, sociobiology, artificial intelligence, and cybernetics, discusses the biologization of technology. She notes how feminists and sociologists have become suspect of evolutionary psychology, particularly inasmuch as sociobiology is subjected to complexity in order to strengthen sexual difference as immutable through pre-existing cultural value judgments about human nature and natural selection. Where feminist theory is criticized for its "false beliefs about human nature," Kember then argues in conclusion that "feminism is in the interesting position of needing to do more biology and evolutionary theory in order not to simply oppose their renewed hegemony, but in order to understand the conditions that make this possible, and to have a say in the construction of new ideas and artefacts."[81]

Other Concepts

Pro-feminism is support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism and of efforts to bring about gender equality. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counseling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also are involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, the development of gender equity curricula in schools, and many other areas. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centers. Some activists of both genders will not refer to men as "feminists" at all, and will refer to all pro-feminist men as "pro-feminists".[82]

Anti-feminism

Opposition to feminism comes in many forms, either criticizing feminist ideology and practice, or arguing that it should be restrained. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, antifeminists opposed particular policy proposals for women's rights, such as the right to vote, educational opportunities, property rights, and access to birth control. In the mid and late twentieth century, antifeminists often opposed the abortion-rights movement and, in the United States, the Equal Rights Amendment.

In the early twenty-first century, some antifeminists in the United States see their ideology as a response to one rooted in hostility towards men, holding feminism responsible for several social problems, including lower college entrance rates of young men, gender differences in suicide, and a perceived decline in manliness in American culture.

Feminists such as Camille Paglia, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jean Bethke Elshtain, and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese have been labeled "antifeminists" by other feminists. Patai and Koerge argue that in this way the term "antifeminist" is used to silence academic debate about feminism.[83]

The ancient world

There is scant evidence of early organized protest against such circumscribed status. In the 3rd century bce, Roman women filled the Capitoline Hill and blocked every entrance to the Forum when consul Marcus Porcius Cato resisted attempts to repeal laws limiting women’s use of expensive goods. “If they are victorious now, what will they not attempt?” Cato cried. “As soon as they begin to be your equals, they will have become your superiors.”

That rebellion proved exceptional, however. For most of recorded history, only isolated voices spoke out against the inferior status of women, presaging the arguments to come. In late 14th- and early 15th-century France, the first feminist philosopher, Christine de Pisan, challenged prevailing attitudes toward women with a bold call for female education. Her mantle was taken up later in the century by Laura Cereta, a 15th-century Venetian woman who published Epistolae familiares (1488; “Personal Letters”; Eng. trans. Collected Letters of a Renaissance Feminist), a volume of letters dealing with a panoply of women’s complaints, from denial of education and marital oppression to the frivolity of women’s attire.

The defense of women had become a literary subgenre by the end of the 16th century, when Il merito delle donne (1600; The Worth of Women), a feminist broadside by another Venetian author, Moderata Fonte, was published posthumously. Defenders of the status quo painted women as superficial and inherently immoral, while the emerging feminists produced long lists of women of courage and accomplishment and proclaimed that women would be the intellectual equals of men if they were given equal access to education.

The so-called “debate about women” did not reach England until the late 16th century, when pamphleteers and polemicists joined battle over the true nature of womanhood. After a series of satiric pieces mocking women was published, the first feminist pamphleteer in England, writing as Jane Anger, responded with Jane Anger, Her Protection for Women (1589). This volley of opinion continued for more than a century, until another English author, Mary Astell, issued a more reasoned rejoinder in A Serious Proposal to the Ladies (1694, 1697). The two-volume work suggested that women inclined neither toward marriage nor a religious vocation should set up secular convents where they might live, study, and teach.
Answer: Feminism originated as a response to gender inequalities and the need for equal rights for women. The term "feminism" was coined by the utopian socialist Charles Fourier and was first used in English in the 1890s in association with the movement for equal political and legal rights for women. Feminism comprises a number of social, cultural, and political movements, theories, and moral philosophies concerned with gender inequalities. It has taken various forms across different disciplines, such as feminist geography, feminist history, and feminist literary criticism. Feminism has evolved through different waves, each focusing on different aspects of gender equality, from legal rights and suffrage to cultural inequalities and personal empowerment. Throughout history, feminism has been shaped by various social, political, and cultural contexts, leading to the development of multiple feminist ideologies and movements worldwide.

The term “feminism” originated from the French word “feminisme,” coined by the utopian socialist Charles Fourier, and was first used in English in the 1890s, in association with the movement for equal political and legal rights for women. Feminism takes a number of forms in a variety of disciplines such as feminist geography, feminist history and feminist literary criticism. Feminism has changed aspects of Western society. Feminist political activists have been concerned with issues such as individual autonomy, political rights, social freedom, economic independence, abortion and reproductive rights, divorce, workplace rights (including maternity leave and equal pay), and education; and putting an end to domestic violence, gender stereotypes, discrimination, sexism, objectification, and prostitution.\\n\\nHistorians of feminism have identified three “waves” of feminist thought and activity. The first wave, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, focused primarily on gaining legal rights, political power and suffrage for women. The second, in the 1960s and 1970s, encouraged women to understand aspects of their own personal lives as deeply politicized, and was largely concerned with other issues of equality, such as the end to discrimination in society, in education and in the work place. The third arose in the early 1990s as a response to perceived failures of the second-wave, and a response to the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second-wave. Throughout most of its history, most leaders of feminist social and political movements, and feminist theorists, have been middle-class white women, predominantly in Britain, France and the US. At least since Sojourner Truth\\\'s 1851 speech to US feminists, however, women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms, and women in former European colonies and the Third World have proposed alternative "post-colonial" and "Third World" feminisms.\\n\\nHistory of Feminism\\n\\nFeminism comprises a number of social, cultural and political movements, theories and moral philosophies concerned with gender inequalities and equal rights for women. In its narrowest interpretation, it refers to the effort to ensure legal and political equality for women; in its broadest sense it comprises any theory which is grounded on the belief that women are oppressed or disadvantaged by comparison with men, and that their oppression is in some way illegitimate or unjustified.\\n\\nThe term “feminism” originated from the French word “feminisme,” coined by the utopian socialist Charles Fourier, and was first used in English in the 1890s, in association with the movement for equal political and legal rights for women. There is some debate as to whether the term “feminism” can be appropriately applied to the thought and activities of earlier women (and men) who explored and challenged the traditional roles of women in society.\\n\\nContemporary feminist historians distinguish three “waves” in the history of feminism. The first-wave refers to the feminism movement of the nineteenth through early twentieth centuries, which dealt mainly with the Suffrage movement. The second-wave (1960s-1980s) dealt with the inequality of laws, as well as cultural inequalities. The third-wave of Feminism (1990s-present), is seen as both a continuation of and a response to the perceived failures of the second-wave.\\n\\nFirst-wave feminism\\n\\nFirst-wave feminism refers to a period of feminist activity during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century in the United Kingdom and the United States. Originally it focused on equal legal rights of contract and property, and opposition to chattel marriage and ownership of married women (and their children) by husbands. A Vindication of the Rights of Women, written by Mary Wollstonecraft in 1742, is considered a germinal essay of feminism. Wollstonecraft protested against the stereotyping of women in domestic roles, the failure to regard women as individuals in their own right, and the failure to educate girls and women to use their intellect.\\n\\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power and women\\\'s suffrage, though feminists like Voltairine de Cleyre (1866 – 1912) and Margaret Sanger (1879 – 1966) were active in campaigning for women\\\'s sexual, reproductive and economic rights. In Britain the Suffragettes campaigned for the women\\\'s vote. In 1918 the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed, granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned houses. In 1928 this was extended to all women over eighteen.\\n\\nIn the United States leaders of this movement include Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery prior to championing women\\\'s right to vote. Other important leaders included Lucy Stone, Olympia Brown, and Helen Pitts. American first-wave feminism involved women from a wide range of backgrounds, some belonging to conservative Christian groups (such as Frances Willard and the Woman\\\'s Christian Temperance Union), others representing the diversity and radicalism of much of second-wave feminism (such as Stanton, Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage and the National Woman Suffrage Association, of which Stanton was president).\\n\\nIn the United States first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1919), granting women the right to vote.\\n\\nSecond-wave feminism\\n\\n“Second-wave feminism” refers to a period of feminist activity beginning in the early 1960s and lasting through the late 1980s. It was a continuation of the earlier phase of feminism which sought legal and political rights in the United Kingdom and the United States. Second-wave feminism has existed continuously since then, and coexists with what is termed “third-wave feminism.” Second-wave feminism saw cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked. The movement encouraged women to understand aspects of their own personal lives as deeply politicized, and reflective of a gender-biased structure of power. While first-wave feminism focused upon absolute rights such as suffrage, second-wave feminism was largely concerned with other issues of equality, such as the end to gender discrimination in society, in education and in the workplace. The title of an essay by Carol Hanisch, "The Personal is Political," became a slogan synonymous with second-wave feminism and the women\\\'s liberation movement.\\n\\nWomen\\\'s liberation in the USA\\n\\nThe term “Women’s Liberation” was first used in 1964 and first appeared in print in 1966. By 1968, although the term “Women’s Liberation Front” appeared in “Ramparts,” the term “women’s liberation” was being used to refer to the whole women’s movement. Although no burning took place, a number of feminine products including bras were thrown into a "Freedom Trash Can," the term "bra-burning" became associated with the movement.[10]\\n\\nThe Feminine Mystique, published in 1963 by Betty Friedan, criticized the idea that women could only find fulfillment through childbearing and homemaking. According to Friedan\\\'s obituary in the The New York Times The Feminine Mystique “ignited the contemporary women\\\'s movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world” and “is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.”[11] Friedan hypothesized that women are victims of a false belief system that requires them to find identity and meaning in their lives through their husbands and children. Such a system causes women to completely lose their identity in that of their family. Friedan specifically located this system among post-World War II middle-class suburban communities. She pointed out that though America\\\'s post-war economic boom had led to the development of new technologies that were supposed to make household work less difficult, they often had the result of making women\\\'s work less meaningful and valuable. She also critiqued Freud\\\'s theory that women were envious of men. Friedan’s book played an important role in encouraging women to question traditional female roles and seek self-fulfillment.[12]\\n\\nThird-wave feminism\\n\\nThird-wave feminism has its origins in the mid 1980s, with feminist leaders rooted in the second-wave like Gloria Anzaldua, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherrie Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and other black feminists, who sought to negotiate prominent space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities.[13]\\n\\nThe third-wave of feminism arose in the early 1990s as a response to perceived failures of the second-wave, and a response to the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second-wave.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: We’ve all bumped our heads at some point. Most of the time, it’s not a big deal and we don’t even need to see a doctor. But sometimes, a head injury can be more serious. In these cases, diagnostic imaging techniques, such as a head CT scan, may be performed to assess the damage. The big question then becomes: should everyone get a CT scan after a head injury? In this blog, we will explore the different types of head injuries, their symptoms, and some guidelines on whether or not a CT scan is needed in order to help you answer that question for yourself.

What is a head injury?

When determining if a CT scan is necessary, we must first understand the definition of a head injury. In the simplest terms, a head injury can be defined as any sort of bump, bruise, cut, fracture, or other type of injury affecting the brain, skull, or scalp.

There are two main types of head injuries: closed and open. A closed head injury occurs when the skull is not broken, while an open head injury occurs when the skull is fractured. Closed head injuries are much more common than open head injuries.

The most common cause of a closed head injury is a blow to the head, such as from a fall or car accident. This type of injury can result in a concussion, which is a type of mild brain injury. It occurs when the head is hit or shaken, which can cause the brain to move around inside the skull. This can lead to bruising and bleeding of the brain tissue. Concussions can also damage nerve cells in the brain. However, it is important to note that not all head injuries result in a concussion. Symptoms of a concussion include:

headache

nausea

vomiting

dizziness

blurry vision

light sensitivity

noise sensitivity

balance problems

fatigue or drowsiness

trouble concentrating or remembering things

Although concussions are one of the most common types of head injuries, there are also other types of head injuries known as:

Diffuse Axonal Injury:

This is a type of brain injury that occurs when the head is shaken violently, such as in a car accident. This can cause the brain to move around inside the skull and lead to swelling of the brain tissue and damage to the brain cells.

Edema:

This is when the brain swells from the injury and presses against the skull

Hematoma:

A hematoma is a collection of blood that pools outside of the blood vessels. A hematoma can occur when there is an injury to the scalp, such as from a fall or car accident. This type of head injury can cause swelling and bruising on the scalp or in the brain.

Hemorrhage:

A hemorrhage is a type of bleeding. An intracerebral hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding within the brain tissue and a subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding around the brain.

Skull fracture:

A skull fracture occurs when one or more bones in the skull are broken. A skull fracture means that damage to the brain is more likely.

Is a CT Scan Needed?

When it comes to head injuries, it is always recommended to seek medical care if you are experiencing one or more of the aforementioned concussion symptoms. In addition to indicating a concussion, these symptoms can also indicate another type of brain injury. It is especially important to seek emergency care right away if you lose consciousness or if you experience confusion or disorientation. By seeking medical attention, your doctor will be able to assess the severity of your head injury and determine if a CT scan is needed.

CT, or computed tomography, scans are a type of x-ray that produces detailed images of the inside of the body. A CT scan is often used to diagnose head injuries because it can show the extent of any damage to the brain. By looking at a CT scan image, doctors can identify any evidence of bleeding, swelling, or skull fractures.

In general, a CT scan is not needed for most people with a concussion or other types of mild brain injuries. This is because mild brain injuries, such as concussions, do not show up on a CT scan and can generally be treated without any significant risks. Not to mention that CT scans do use radiation, so they are only recommended when absolutely necessary.

However, there are some exceptions. For example, if the person has any of the following signs, then a CT scan is usually performed to rule out a more serious brain injury:

trouble speaking, hearing, or swallowing

seizures

vision problems

weakness on one side of the face or body

prolonged loss of consciousness

mismatched pupil sizes

skull tenderness

severe vomiting and/or headache

fluid coming from the ear or nose

Additionally, people who are at a higher risk for skull fractures or bleeding may also require a CT scan. This includes individuals who are on blood thinners.

If you or someone you know has suffered a head injury, the best thing to do is to seek medical attention right away. While most cases of mild traumatic brain injuries, such as concussions, do not need a CT scan, it is still recommended to have that decision made by a medical professional.

In Conclusion

In this blog, we have defined types of head injuries in order to help answer the question: should everyone get a CT scan after a head injury? The answer is, it depends. If you are experiencing any of the concussion symptoms, then it is highly recommended to seek medical attention right away so that your doctor can help you decide whether a CT scan is necessary. In most cases a CT scan is not necessary for people with concussions and is usually only required for more severe head injuries. However, there may be some exceptions depending on the individual’s symptoms and risk factors, which is why it is important to seek medical attention after experiencing a head injury. It is always better to be safe rather than sorry! We hope this blog was helpful in clarifying when a CT scan is necessary after a head injury.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is an imaging scan that uses X-rays to develop a 3D image of the skull, brain, and other related areas of the head. A CT scan of the head can provide more detail than a traditional X-ray, which is particularly useful when a doctor wants to check the blood vessels and soft tissues in the body. In this article, we explain why a doctor may order a CT scan of the head and what a person can expect if they need to undergo this procedure.

When do people need a CT head scan? Share on Pinterest A person may have a CT head scan after trauma to check for damage. A doctor may use a CT head scan to get images in an emergency, to make a medical diagnosis, or to see how well treatments are working. Some of the reasons why a doctor may order a head CT scan include: looking for possible damage after trauma to the head, such as soft tissue injuries, brain bleeding, and bone injuries

assessing a person having stroke-like symptoms to see whether there are signs of a blood clot or brain bleeding

looking for a possible brain tumor or other brain abnormality

checking the effectiveness of medical treatments in shrinking a brain tumor

assessing birth conditions that cause the skull to form abnormally

evaluating a person with a history of hydrocephalus, a condition in which an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid causes the enlargement of the brain ventricles If a person is having brain-related symptoms, such as changes in personality or affected movement, a doctor may order a head CT scan to make sure that a brain abnormality is not the underlying cause.

Test procedure A doctor should provide specific instructions for the day of the CT scan. These will include whether or not to refrain from eating or drinking for a certain period before the scan. The doctor will also usually ask the person to take off any jewelry, removable dental work, or hairpins because these can affect the scan’s images. Sometimes, people who take metformin (Glucophage) may need to refrain from using it for a few days before getting a CT scan with contrast dye. The combination of this drug and the dye can cause a severe reaction in some individuals. Contrast dye is a substance that the person may receive by injection before a scan. It makes certain areas of the body show up more easily on a scan. However, not all CT scans require contrast dye. The person will often complete a checklist before undergoing the scan. The checklist includes a medical history of conditions that can affect a person’s health, such as kidney disease, heart disease, asthma, and thyroid problems. Some health issues may affect a person’s ability to receive intravenous (IV) contrast. The scanner usually looks like a circle shaped machine that has a hole in its center. In the center, there is a bed on which a person lies during the procedure. The scanner is usually open, which helps the person feel less claustrophobic. A radiology technician may ask the person to change into a gown before going into the room with the CT scanner. Before the scan, a radiology technician may put an IV line in place, usually in the person’s arm, if the scan uses contrast dye. During the scan, the radiology technician will talk to the person via a speaker to let them know them when the scan is starting. The scanner will direct X-ray beams at the person’s head. The X-rays will come back to the scanner, transmitting the images back to a computer. After the initial scan, the radiology technician may deliver the IV contrast material. They will then restart the CT scan. The technologist will review the images to ensure that they are of high quality and are free of blurring in any key areas. The average CT scan of the head takes no more than 10 minutes.

CT head scans in children Share on Pinterest Children are sensitive to radiation, so a doctor may only order a CT scan when necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Doctors may order a CT head scan if a child has experienced a recent injury or has a medical history of skull or brain abnormalities. As a CT scan is relatively quick, many children can stay still long enough for the technician to complete the scan. However, if a child cannot remain still for the scan — as is the case for babies — it may be necessary to perform the procedure with the child under anesthesia. Children are typically more sensitive to radiation than adults. As a result, doctors tend to reserve CT scans for when they are necessary to make a diagnosis. A radiology technician can usually adjust the settings on a CT scanner to deliver the lowest possible dose of radiation.

Risks The CT scan is a painless, noninvasive procedure, and doctors generally consider it to be safe. However, it carries some possible risks. As a CT scan exposes a person to radiation, there is a risk that the person could develop cancer from excessive radiation doses. However, the risks for this after one CT head scan are minimal. A person can ask their doctor if they should be concerned about the radiation dose from a CT head scan. Doctors will usually recommend that women avoid CT scans during pregnancy. However, as one CT scan is unlikely to pose a significant risk, a doctor can offer advice on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Read about the safety of X-rays here. A CT scan can be noisy. Sometimes, this noise or the fear of being in an enclosed space can provoke anxiety in a person. For this reason, doctors may sometimes give a person sedating medicines before they go into the CT scanner. If a person receives a contrast dye during the procedure, they could be at risk of experiencing an allergic reaction to the dye. Contrast dye can also cause other symptoms that may be temporarily unpleasant but are not an allergic reaction. These may include a warm feeling throughout the body, a burning sensation, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Sometimes, a doctor may prescribe a steroid or advise a person to take diphenhydramine (Benadryl) before undergoing the scan.

Results A medical specialist called a radiologist will examine the imaging scans, looking for any abnormalities in the brain and surrounding tissues. They will write a report of their findings and send it to the doctor who ordered the scan. If a person is in the hospital and undergoing the scan as an emergency, the radiologist will report any immediately concerning results as quickly as possible.

CT scan vs. MRI scan Share on Pinterest A person’s doctor can advise on which type of scan is best to diagnose a certain condition. Sometimes, a doctor may recommend both a CT scan and an MRI scan of the head. An MRI scan does not expose a person to radiation. Instead, the device uses a magnetic field to generate images of the body’s soft tissues. While a CT scan is helpful in displaying some aspects of the head and brain, an MRI scan sometimes has higher sensitivity. As a result, it may be more effective in revealing disease processes in the brain and inflammation in the membranes covering the brain, which are known as the meninges. Doctors will consider the advantages of each type of scan for scanning the head. The benefits of a CT scan compared with an MRI scan include: A CT scan is faster than an MRI scan, so doctors usually use it for emergencies.

A CT scan generally costs less than an MRI scan.

Doctors can perform a CT scan on a person who has metal devices, such as a pacemaker, nerve stimulator, or cochlear implant. A person with these devices cannot undergo an MRI because of the magnet’s attraction to metal. The benefits of an MRI scan compared with a CT scan include: An MRI does not involve radiation exposure, making it preferable for children who may require multiple scans.

MRI scans can show soft tissues and structures that bone may hide in a CT scan.

A person requires a smaller amount of IV contrast for an MRI scan than for a CT scan. People can talk to their doctor to evaluate the aspects of each scan and determine which is most appropriate for them.
Answer: No, it is not suggested to conduct a head CT scan for every head trauma case. A CT scan is generally not needed for most people with a concussion or other types of mild brain injuries, as these do not typically show up on a CT scan and can be treated without significant risks. CT scans are recommended when there are signs of a more serious brain injury, such as trouble speaking, seizures, vision problems, prolonged loss of consciousness, or other severe symptoms. It is important to seek medical attention after a head injury to determine if a CT scan is necessary based on individual symptoms and risk factors.

A CT scan is often used to diagnose head injuries because it can show the extent of any damage to the brain. By looking at a CT scan image, doctors can identify any evidence of bleeding, swelling, or skull fractures.\\n\\nIn general, a CT scan is not needed for most people with a concussion or other types of mild brain injuries. This is because mild brain injuries, such as concussions, do not show up on a CT scan and can generally be treated without any significant risks. Not to mention that CT scans do use radiation, so they are only recommended when absolutely necessary.\\n\\nHowever, there are some exceptions. For example, if the person has any of the following signs, then a CT scan is usually performed to rule out a more serious brain injury:\\n\\ntrouble speaking, hearing, or swallowing\\n\\nseizures\\n\\nvision problems\\n\\nweakness on one side of the face or body\\n\\nprolonged loss of consciousness\\n\\nmismatched pupil sizes\\n\\nskull tenderness\\n\\nsevere vomiting and/or headache\\n\\nfluid coming from the ear or nose\\n\\nAdditionally, people who are at a higher risk for skull fractures or bleeding may also require a CT scan. This includes individuals who are on blood thinners.\\n\\nIf you or someone you know has suffered a head injury, the best thing to do is to seek medical attention right away. While most cases of mild traumatic brain injuries, such as concussions, do not need a CT scan, it is still recommended to have that decision made by a medical professional.\\n\\nIn Conclusion\\n\\nIn this blog, we have defined types of head injuries in order to help answer the question: should everyone get a CT scan after a head injury? The answer is, it depends. If you are experiencing any of the concussion symptoms, then it is highly recommended to seek medical attention right away so that your doctor can help you decide whether a CT scan is necessary. In most cases a CT scan is not necessary for people with concussions and is usually only required for more severe head injuries. However, there may be some exceptions depending on the individual’s symptoms and risk factors, which is why it is important to seek medical attention after experiencing a head injury. It is always better to be safe rather than sorry!

A CT scan of the head can provide more detail than a traditional X-ray, which is particularly useful when a doctor wants to check the blood vessels and soft tissues in the body. In this article, we explain why a doctor may order a CT scan of the head and what a person can expect if they need to undergo this procedure.\\n\\nWhen do people need a CT head scan? Share on Pinterest A person may have a CT head scan after trauma to check for damage. A doctor may use a CT head scan to get images in an emergency, to make a medical diagnosis, or to see how well treatments are working. Some of the reasons why a doctor may order a head CT scan include: looking for possible damage after trauma to the head, such as soft tissue injuries, brain bleeding, and bone injuries\\n\\nassessing a person having stroke-like symptoms to see whether there are signs of a blood clot or brain bleeding\\n\\nlooking for a possible brain tumor or other brain abnormality\\n\\nchecking the effectiveness of medical treatments in shrinking a brain tumor\\n\\nassessing birth conditions that cause the skull to form abnormally\\n\\nevaluating a person with a history of hydrocephalus, a condition in which an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid causes the enlargement of the brain ventricles If a person is having brain-related symptoms, such as changes in personality or affected movement, a doctor may order a head CT scan to make sure that a brain abnormality is not the underlying cause.\\n\\nTest procedure A doctor should provide specific instructions for the day of the CT scan. These will include whether or not to refrain from eating or drinking for a certain period before the scan. The doctor will also usually ask the person to take off any jewelry, removable dental work, or hairpins because these can affect the scan’s images. Sometimes, people who take metformin (Glucophage) may need to refrain from using it for a few days before getting a CT scan with contrast dye. The combination of this drug and the dye can cause a severe reaction in some individuals. Contrast dye is a substance that the person may receive by injection before a scan. It makes certain areas of the body show up more easily on a scan. However, not all CT scans require contrast dye. The person will often complete a checklist before undergoing the scan. The checklist includes a medical history of conditions that can affect a person’s health, such as kidney disease, heart disease, asthma, and thyroid problems. Some health issues may affect a person’s ability to receive intravenous (IV) contrast. The scanner usually looks like a circle shaped machine that has a hole in its center. In the center, there is a bed on which a person lies during the procedure. The scanner is usually open, which helps the person feel less claustrophobic. A radiology technician may ask the person to change into a gown before going into the room with the CT scanner. Before the scan, a radiology technician may put an IV line in place, usually in the person’s arm, if the scan uses contrast dye. During the scan, the radiology technician will talk to the person via a speaker to let them know them when the scan is starting. The scanner will direct X-ray beams at the person’s head. The X-rays will come back to the scanner, transmitting the images back to a computer. After the initial scan, the radiology technician may deliver the IV contrast material. They will then restart the CT scan. The technologist will review the images to ensure that they are of high quality and are free of blurring in any key areas. The average CT scan of the head takes no more than 10 minutes.\\n\\nCT head scans in children Share on Pinterest Children are sensitive to radiation, so a doctor may only order a CT scan when necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Doctors may order a CT head scan if a child has experienced a recent injury or has a medical history of skull or brain abnormalities. As a CT scan is relatively quick, many children can stay still long enough for the technician to complete the scan. However, if a child cannot remain still for the scan — as is the case for babies — it may be necessary to perform the procedure with the child under anesthesia. Children are typically more sensitive to radiation than adults. As a result, doctors tend to reserve CT scans for when they are necessary to make a diagnosis. A radiology technician can usually adjust the settings on a CT scanner to deliver the lowest possible dose of radiation.\\n\\nRisks The CT scan is a painless, noninvasive procedure, and doctors generally consider it to be safe. However, it carries some possible risks. As a CT scan exposes a person to radiation, there is a risk that the person could develop cancer from excessive radiation doses. However, the risks for this after one CT head scan are minimal. A person can ask their doctor if they should be concerned about the radiation dose from a CT head scan. Doctors will usually recommend that women avoid CT scans during pregnancy. However, as one CT scan is unlikely to pose a significant risk, a doctor can offer advice on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Read about the safety of X-rays here. A CT scan can be noisy. Sometimes, this noise or the fear of being in an enclosed space can provoke anxiety in a person. For this reason, doctors may sometimes give a person sedating medicines before they go into the CT scanner. If a person receives a contrast dye during the procedure, they could be at risk of experiencing an allergic reaction to the dye. Contrast dye can also cause other symptoms that may be temporarily unpleasant but are not an allergic reaction. These may include a warm feeling throughout the body, a burning sensation, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Sometimes, a doctor may prescribe a steroid or advise a person to take diphenhydramine (Benadryl) before undergoing the scan.\\n\\nResults A medical specialist called a radiologist will examine the imaging scans, looking for any abnormalities in the brain and surrounding tissues. They will write a report of their findings and send it to the doctor who ordered the scan. If a person is in the hospital and undergoing the scan as an emergency, the radiologist will report any immediately concerning results as quickly as possible.\\n\\nCT scan vs. MRI scan Share on Pinterest A person’s doctor can advise on which type of scan is best to diagnose a certain condition. Sometimes, a doctor may recommend both a CT scan and an MRI scan of the head. An MRI scan does not expose a person to radiation. Instead, the device uses a magnetic field to generate images of the body’s soft tissues. While a CT scan is helpful in displaying some aspects of the head and brain, an MRI scan sometimes has higher sensitivity. As a result, it may be more effective in revealing disease processes in the brain and inflammation in the membranes covering the brain, which are known as the meninges. Doctors will consider the advantages of each type of scan for scanning the head. The benefits of a CT scan compared with an MRI scan include: A CT scan is faster than an MRI scan, so doctors usually use it for emergencies.\\n\\nA CT scan generally costs less than an MRI scan.\\n\\nDoctors can perform a CT scan on a person who has metal devices, such as a pacemaker, nerve stimulator, or cochlear implant. A person with these devices cannot undergo an MRI because of the magnet’s attraction to metal. The benefits of an MRI scan compared with a CT scan include: An MRI does not involve radiation exposure, making it preferable for children who may require multiple scans.\\n\\nMRI scans can show soft tissues and structures that bone may hide in a CT scan.\\n\\nA person requires a smaller amount of IV contrast for an MRI scan than for a CT scan. People can talk to their doctor to evaluate the aspects of each scan and determine which is most appropriate for them.', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.8793785572052002, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:4270'})]
Answer: No, it is not suggested to conduct a head CT scan for every head trauma case. Most cases of mild traumatic brain injuries, such as concussions, do not require a CT scan. CT scans are generally recommended only when there are specific symptoms or risk factors indicating a more serious brain injury. These symptoms include trouble speaking, hearing, or swallowing, seizures, vision problems, weakness on one side of the face or body, prolonged loss of consciousness, mismatched pupil sizes, skull tenderness, severe vomiting and/or headache, and fluid coming from the ear or nose. Additionally, individuals at higher risk for skull fractures or bleeding, such as those on blood thinners, may also require a CT scan. It is important to seek medical attention after a head injury to have a professional determine if a CT scan is necessary.

This bicameral system distributes power within two houses that check and balance one another rather than concentrating authority in a single body. The House of Representatives is the larger body with membership based on each state’s population. The Senate is the smaller body with each state having two delegates. With one hundred members, the Senate is a more intimate, less formal legislative body than the House, which has 435 members elected from districts that are roughly the same size in population. Members of Congress must reside in the district or state that elects them, although the Constitution does not specify for how long.

Answer: In the U.S. bicameral system, the main differences between the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives (often referred to as Congress) are as follows:

1. **Size and Representation**:
   - The House of Representatives is the larger body with 435 members. Membership is based on each state's population, with representatives elected from districts that are roughly the same size in population.
   - The Senate is the smaller body with 100 members, consisting of two delegates from each state, regardless of the state's population.

2. **Term Length**:
   - Members of the House of Representatives are subject to reelection every two years, making it the most democratic of the national institutions.
   - Senators serve six-year terms, with elections staggered so that approximately one-third of the Senate is up for reelection every two years.

3. **Nature and Function**:
   - The House is designed to be a more democratic institution, reflecting the immediate will of the people.
   - The Senate is intended to be an elite body that acts as a check on the House, providing stability and a longer-term perspective.

4. **Formality and Intimacy**:
   - The House, with its larger membership, is a more formal legislative body.
   - The Senate, with only 100 members, is a more intimate and less formal legislative body.

5. **Residency Requirements**:
   - Members of both the House and the Senate must reside in the district or state that elects them, although the Constitution does not specify for how long. Residency can become a campaign issue.

These differences reflect the founders' intention to create a system that balances power and prevents any one governmental body from becoming too strong.

But the mystery of how two small armies — the Babylonians in the south and the Medes in the east — were able to converge on Nineveh and completely destroy what was then the largest city in the world, without any reoccupation, has remained unsolved.\\n\\nA team of researchers — using archival and archaeological data contributed by Harvey Weiss, professor of Near Eastern archaeology and environmental studies at Yale — was able for the first time to determine the underlying cause for the collapse. By examining new precipitation records of the area, the team discovered an abrupt 60-year megadrought that so weakened the Assyrian state that Nineveh was overrun in three months and abandoned forever. The research was published in Science Advances on Nov. 13.\\n\\nAssyria was an agrarian society dependent on seasonal precipitation for cereal agriculture. To its south, the Babylonians relied on irrigation agriculture, so their resources, government, and society were not affected by the drought, explains Weiss.\\n\\nThe team analyzed stalagmites — a type of speleothem that grows up from a cave floor and is formed by the deposit of minerals from water — retrieved from Kuna Ba cave in northeast Iraq. The speleothems can provide a history of climate through the oxygen and uranium isotope ratios of infiltrating water that are preserved in its layers. Oxygen in rainwater comes in two main varieties: heavy and light. The ratio of heavy to light types of oxygen isotopes are extremely sensitive to variations in precipitation and temperature. Over time, uranium trapped in speleothems turns into thorium, allowing scientists to date the speleothem deposits.\\n\\nWeiss and the research team synchronized these findings with archaeological and cuneiform records and were able to document the first paleoclimate data for the megadrought that affected the Assyrian heartland at the time of the empire’s collapse, when its less drought-affected neighbors invaded. The team’s research also revealed that this megadrought followed a high-rainfall period that facilitated the Assyrian empire’s earlier growth and expansion.\\n\\n“Now we have a historical and environmental dynamic between north and south and between rain-fed agriculture and irrigation-fed agriculture through which we can understand the historical process of how the Babylonians were able to defeat the Assyrians,” said Weiss, adding that the total collapse of Assyria is still described by historians as the “mother of all catastrophes.”\\n\\nThrough the archaeology and history of the region, Weiss was able to piece together how the megadrought data were synchronous with Assyria’s cessation of long-distance military campaigns and the construction of irrigation canals that were similar to its southern neighbors but restricted in their agricultural extent. Other texts noted that the Assyrians were worrying about their alliances with distant places, while also fearing internal intrigue, notes Weiss.\\n\\nThese societies experienced climatic changes that were of such magnitude they could not simply adapt to them. Harvey Weiss\\n\\n“This fits into a historical pattern that is not only structured through time and space, but a time and space that is filled with environmental change,” says Weiss. “These societies experienced climatic changes that were of such magnitude they could not simply adapt to them,” he adds.\\n\\nWith these new speleothem records, says Weiss, paleoclimatologists and archaeologists are now able to identify environmental changes in the global historical record that were unknown and inaccessible even 25 years ago. “History is no longer two-dimensional; the historical stage is now three-dimensional,” said Weiss.\\n\\nWeiss’ previous research defined the 2200 B.C.E. global megadrought that generated societal collapse from the Mediterranean to China.\\n\\nIn addition to Weiss, researchers from California State University-Dominguez Hills, Xi’an Jiaotong University, University of Minnesota, University of Colorado-Boulder, University of Illinois-Chicago, University of Ankara, and University of Southern California contributed to the study.', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.7550549507141113, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:2960'})]
Answer: It would not be fair to try a new method to unroll the Herculaneum papyri if it could potentially destroy them.

2. **Fluorescence in situ Hybridization and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (FISH-CLSM) Combined with Dual Culture Assays**: These methods allow for the visualization and analysis of spatial relationships and interactions between the bacteria, which can provide insights into the nature of their symbiotic relationship.

These experiments are useful for testing hypotheses about microbial interactions and can help determine whether the relationship is mutualistic, commensal, or parasitic.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Acquisition of information at a significant distance from the subject

Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, in contrast to in situ or on-site observation. The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets. Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geophysics, geography, land surveying and most Earth science disciplines (e.g. exploration geophysics, hydrology, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology); it also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications, among others.

In current usage, the term remote sensing generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. It includes the surface and the atmosphere and oceans, based on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation). It may be split into "active" remote sensing (when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft to the object and its reflection detected by the sensor) and "passive" remote sensing (when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor).

Overview [ edit ]

This video is about how Landsat was used to identify areas of conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and how it was used to help map an area called MLW in the north.

Remote sensing can be divided into two types of methods: Passive remote sensing and Active remote sensing. Passive sensors gather radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors. Examples of passive remote sensors include film photography, infrared, charge-coupled devices, and radiometers. Active collection, on the other hand, emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. RADAR and LiDAR are examples of active remote sensing where the time delay between emission and return is measured, establishing the location, speed and direction of an object.

Illustration of remote sensing

Remote sensing makes it possible to collect data of dangerous or inaccessible areas. Remote sensing applications include monitoring deforestation in areas such as the Amazon Basin, glacial features in Arctic and Antarctic regions, and depth sounding of coastal and ocean depths. Military collection during the Cold War made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas. Remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground, ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed.

Orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as El Niño and other natural long and short term phenomena. Other uses include different areas of the earth sciences such as natural resource management, agricultural fields such as land usage and conservation, greenhouse gas monitoring, oil spill detection and monitoring, and national security and overhead, ground-based and stand-off collection on border areas.

Types of data acquisition techniques [ edit ]

The basis for multispectral collection and analysis is that of examined areas or objects that reflect or emit radiation that stand out from surrounding areas. For a summary of major remote sensing satellite systems see the overview table.

Applications of remote sensing [ edit ]

Conventional radar is mostly associated with aerial traffic control, early warning, and certain large-scale meteorological data. Doppler radar is used by local law enforcements' monitoring of speed limits and in enhanced meteorological collection such as wind speed and direction within weather systems in addition to precipitation location and intensity. Other types of active collection includes plasmas in the ionosphere. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar is used to produce precise digital elevation models of large scale terrain (See RADARSAT, TerraSAR-X, Magellan).

Laser and radar altimeters on satellites have provided a wide range of data. By measuring the bulges of water caused by gravity, they map features on the seafloor to a resolution of a mile or so. By measuring the height and wavelength of ocean waves, the altimeters measure wind speeds and direction, and surface ocean currents and directions.

Ultrasound (acoustic) and radar tide gauges measure sea level, tides and wave direction in coastal and offshore tide gauges.

Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is well known in examples of weapon ranging, laser illuminated homing of projectiles. LIDAR is used to detect and measure the concentration of various chemicals in the atmosphere, while airborne LIDAR can be used to measure the heights of objects and features on the ground more accurately than with radar technology. Vegetation remote sensing is a principal application of LIDAR. [10]

Radiometers and photometers are the most common instrument in use, collecting reflected and emitted radiation in a wide range of frequencies. The most common are visible and infrared sensors, followed by microwave, gamma-ray, and rarely, ultraviolet. They may also be used to detect the emission spectra of various chemicals, providing data on chemical concentrations in the atmosphere.

Geodetic [ edit ]

Geodetic remote sensing can be gravimetric or geometric. Overhead gravity data collection was first used in aerial submarine detection. This data revealed minute perturbations in the Earth's gravitational field that may be used to determine changes in the mass distribution of the Earth, which in turn may be used for geophysical studies, as in GRACE. Geometric remote sensing includes position and deformation imaging using InSAR, LIDAR, etc.[26]

Acoustic and near-acoustic [ edit ]

Sonar: passive sonar , listening for the sound made by another object (a vessel, a whale etc.); active sonar , emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes, used for detecting, ranging and measurements of underwater objects and terrain.

, listening for the sound made by another object (a vessel, a whale etc.); , emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes, used for detecting, ranging and measurements of underwater objects and terrain. Seismograms taken at different locations can locate and measure earthquakes (after they occur) by comparing the relative intensity and precise timings.

Ultrasound: Ultrasound sensors, that emit high-frequency pulses and listening for echoes, used for detecting water waves and water level, as in tide gauges or for towing tanks.

To coordinate a series of large-scale observations, most sensing systems depend on the following: platform location and the orientation of the sensor. High-end instruments now often use positional information from satellite navigation systems. The rotation and orientation are often provided within a degree or two with electronic compasses. Compasses can measure not just azimuth (i. e. degrees to magnetic north), but also altitude (degrees above the horizon), since the magnetic field curves into the Earth at different angles at different latitudes. More exact orientations require gyroscopic-aided orientation, periodically realigned by different methods including navigation from stars or known benchmarks.

Data characteristics [ edit ]

The quality of remote sensing data consists of its spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions.

Spatial resolution The size of a pixel that is recorded in a raster image – typically pixels may correspond to square areas ranging in side length from 1 to 1,000 metres (3.3 to 3,280.8 ft). Spectral resolution The wavelength of the different frequency bands recorded – usually, this is related to the number of frequency bands recorded by the platform. Current Landsat collection is that of seven bands, including several in the infrared spectrum, ranging from a spectral resolution of 0.7 to 2.1 μm. The Hyperion sensor on Earth Observing-1 resolves 220 bands from 0.4 to 2.5 μm, with a spectral resolution of 0.10 to 0.11 μm per band. Radiometric resolution The number of different intensities of radiation the sensor is able to distinguish. Typically, this ranges from 8 to 14 bits, corresponding to 256 levels of the gray scale and up to 16,384 intensities or "shades" of colour, in each band. It also depends on the instrument noise. Temporal resolution The frequency of flyovers by the satellite or plane, and is only relevant in time-series studies or those requiring an averaged or mosaic image as in deforesting monitoring. This was first used by the intelligence community where repeated coverage revealed changes in infrastructure, the deployment of units or the modification/introduction of equipment. Cloud cover over a given area or object makes it necessary to repeat the collection of said location.

Data processing [ edit ]

In order to create sensor-based maps, most remote sensing systems expect to extrapolate sensor data in relation to a reference point including distances between known points on the ground. This depends on the type of sensor used. For example, in conventional photographs, distances are accurate in the center of the image, with the distortion of measurements increasing the farther you get from the center. Another factor is that of the platen against which the film is pressed can cause severe errors when photographs are used to measure ground distances. The step in which this problem is resolved is called georeferencing and involves computer-aided matching of points in the image (typically 30 or more points per image) which is extrapolated with the use of an established benchmark, "warping" the image to produce accurate spatial data. As of the early 1990s, most satellite images are sold fully georeferenced.

In addition, images may need to be radiometrically and atmospherically corrected.

Radiometric correction Allows avoidance of radiometric errors and distortions. The illumination of objects on the Earth's surface is uneven because of different properties of the relief. This factor is taken into account in the method of radiometric distortion correction.[27] Radiometric correction gives a scale to the pixel values, e. g. the monochromatic scale of 0 to 255 will be converted to actual radiance values. Topographic correction (also called terrain correction) In rugged mountains, as a result of terrain, the effective illumination of pixels varies considerably. In a remote sensing image, the pixel on the shady slope receives weak illumination and has a low radiance value, in contrast, the pixel on the sunny slope receives strong illumination and has a high radiance value. For the same object, the pixel radiance value on the shady slope will be different from that on the sunny slope. Additionally, different objects may have similar radiance values. These ambiguities seriously affected remote sensing image information extraction accuracy in mountainous areas. It became the main obstacle to the further application of remote sensing images. The purpose of topographic correction is to eliminate this effect, recovering the true reflectivity or radiance of objects in horizontal conditions. It is the premise of quantitative remote sensing application. Atmospheric correction Elimination of atmospheric haze by rescaling each frequency band so that its minimum value (usually realised in water bodies) corresponds to a pixel value of 0. The digitizing of data also makes it possible to manipulate the data by changing gray-scale values.

Interpretation is the critical process of making sense of the data. The first application was that of aerial photographic collection which used the following process; spatial measurement through the use of a light table in both conventional single or stereographic coverage, added skills such as the use of photogrammetry, the use of photomosaics, repeat coverage, Making use of objects' known dimensions in order to detect modifications. Image Analysis is the recently developed automated computer-aided application that is in increasing use.

Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is a sub-discipline of GIScience devoted to partitioning remote sensing (RS) imagery into meaningful image-objects, and assessing their characteristics through spatial, spectral and temporal scale.

Old data from remote sensing is often valuable because it may provide the only long-term data for a large extent of geography. At the same time, the data is often complex to interpret, and bulky to store. Modern systems tend to store the data digitally, often with lossless compression. The difficulty with this approach is that the data is fragile, the format may be archaic, and the data may be easy to falsify. One of the best systems for archiving data series is as computer-generated machine-readable ultrafiche, usually in typefonts such as OCR-B, or as digitized half-tone images. Ultrafiches survive well in standard libraries, with lifetimes of several centuries. They can be created, copied, filed and retrieved by automated systems. They are about as compact as archival magnetic media, and yet can be read by human beings with minimal, standardized equipment.

Generally speaking, remote sensing works on the principle of the inverse problem: while the object or phenomenon of interest (the state) may not be directly measured, there exists some other variable that can be detected and measured (the observation) which may be related to the object of interest through a calculation. The common analogy given to describe this is trying to determine the type of animal from its footprints. For example, while it is impossible to directly measure temperatures in the upper atmosphere, it is possible to measure the spectral emissions from a known chemical species (such as carbon dioxide) in that region. The frequency of the emissions may then be related via thermodynamics to the temperature in that region.

Data processing levels [ edit ]

To facilitate the discussion of data processing in practice, several processing "levels" were first defined in 1986 by NASA as part of its Earth Observing System[28] and steadily adopted since then, both internally at NASA (e. g.,[29]) and elsewhere (e. g.,[30]); these definitions are:

Level Description 0 Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument and payload data at full resolution, with any and all communications artifacts (e. g., synchronization frames, communications headers, duplicate data) removed. 1a Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time-referenced, and annotated with ancillary information, including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters (e. g., platform ephemeris) computed and appended but not applied to the Level 0 data (or if applied, in a manner that level 0 is fully recoverable from level 1a data). 1b Level 1a data that have been processed to sensor units (e. g., radar backscatter cross section, brightness temperature, etc.); not all instruments have Level 1b data; level 0 data is not recoverable from level 1b data. 2 Derived geophysical variables (e. g., ocean wave height, soil moisture, ice concentration) at the same resolution and location as Level 1 source data. 3 Variables mapped on uniform spacetime grid scales, usually with some completeness and consistency (e. g., missing points interpolated, complete regions mosaicked together from multiple orbits, etc.). 4 Model output or results from analyses of lower level data (i. e., variables that were not measured by the instruments but instead are derived from these measurements).

A Level 1 data record is the most fundamental (i. e., highest reversible level) data record that has significant scientific utility, and is the foundation upon which all subsequent data sets are produced. Level 2 is the first level that is directly usable for most scientific applications; its value is much greater than the lower levels. Level 2 data sets tend to be less voluminous than Level 1 data because they have been reduced temporally, spatially, or spectrally. Level 3 data sets are generally smaller than lower level data sets and thus can be dealt with without incurring a great deal of data handling overhead. These data tend to be generally more useful for many applications. The regular spatial and temporal organization of Level 3 datasets makes it feasible to readily combine data from different sources.

While these processing levels are particularly suitable for typical satellite data processing pipelines, other data level vocabularies have been defined and may be appropriate for more heterogeneous workflows.

History [ edit ]

The 2001 Mars Odyssey used spectrometers and imagers to hunt for evidence of past or present water and volcanic activity on Mars.

The modern discipline of remote sensing arose with the development of flight. The balloonist G. Tournachon (alias Nadar) made photographs of Paris from his balloon in 1858.[31] Messenger pigeons, kites, rockets and unmanned balloons were also used for early images. With the exception of balloons, these first, individual images were not particularly useful for map making or for scientific purposes.

Systematic aerial photography was developed for military surveillance and reconnaissance purposes beginning in World War I[32] and reaching a climax during the Cold War with the use of modified combat aircraft such as the P-51, P-38, RB-66 and the F-4C, or specifically designed collection platforms such as the U2/TR-1, SR-71, A-5 and the OV-1 series both in overhead and stand-off collection.[33] A more recent development is that of increasingly smaller sensor pods such as those used by law enforcement and the military, in both manned and unmanned platforms. The advantage of this approach is that this requires minimal modification to a given airframe. Later imaging technologies would include infrared, conventional, Doppler and synthetic aperture radar.[34]

The development of artificial satellites in the latter half of the 20th century allowed remote sensing to progress to a global scale as of the end of the Cold War.[35] Instrumentation aboard various Earth observing and weather satellites such as Landsat, the Nimbus and more recent missions such as RADARSAT and UARS provided global measurements of various data for civil, research, and military purposes. Space probes to other planets have also provided the opportunity to conduct remote sensing studies in extraterrestrial environments, synthetic aperture radar aboard the Magellan spacecraft provided detailed topographic maps of Venus, while instruments aboard SOHO allowed studies to be performed on the Sun and the solar wind, just to name a few examples.[36][37]

Recent developments include, beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, the development of image processing of satellite imagery. The use of the term "remote sensing" began in the early 1960s when Evelyn Pruitt realized that advances in science meant that aerial photography was no longer an adequate term to describe the data streams being generated by new technologies.[38][39] With assistance from her fellow staff member at the Office of Naval Research, Walter Bailey, she coined the term "remote sensing".[40][41] Several research groups in Silicon Valley including NASA Ames Research Center, GTE, and ESL Inc. developed Fourier transform techniques leading to the first notable enhancement of imagery data. In 1999 the first commercial satellite (IKONOS) collecting very high resolution imagery was launched.[42]

Training and education [ edit ]

Remote Sensing has a growing relevance in the modern information society. It represents a key technology as part of the aerospace industry and bears increasing economic relevance – new sensors e.g. TerraSAR-X and RapidEye are developed constantly and the demand for skilled labour is increasing steadily. Furthermore, remote sensing exceedingly influences everyday life, ranging from weather forecasts to reports on climate change or natural disasters. As an example, 80% of the German students use the services of Google Earth; in 2006 alone the software was downloaded 100 million times. But studies have shown that only a fraction of them know more about the data they are working with.[43] There exists a huge knowledge gap between the application and the understanding of satellite images. Remote sensing only plays a tangential role in schools, regardless of the political claims to strengthen the support for teaching on the subject.[44] A lot of the computer software explicitly developed for school lessons has not yet been implemented due to its complexity. Thereby, the subject is either not at all integrated into the curriculum or does not pass the step of an interpretation of analogue images. In fact, the subject of remote sensing requires a consolidation of physics and mathematics as well as competences in the fields of media and methods apart from the mere visual interpretation of satellite images.

Many teachers have great interest in the subject "remote sensing", being motivated to integrate this topic into teaching, provided that the curriculum is considered. In many cases, this encouragement fails because of confusing information.[45] In order to integrate remote sensing in a sustainable manner organizations like the EGU or Digital Earth[46] encourage the development of learning modules and learning portals. Examples include: FIS – Remote Sensing in School Lessons,[47] Geospektiv,[48] Ychange,[49] or Spatial Discovery,[50] to promote media and method qualifications as well as independent learning.

Software [ edit ]

Remote sensing data are processed and analyzed with computer software, known as a remote sensing application. A large number of proprietary and open source applications exist to process remote sensing data.

Remote Sensing with gamma rays [ edit ]

There are applications of gamma rays to mineral exploration through remote sensing. In 1972 more than two million dollars were spent on remote sensing applications with gamma rays to mineral exploration. Gamma rays are used to search for deposits of uranium. By observing radioactivity from potassium, porphyry copper deposits can be located. A high ratio of uranium to thorium has been found to be related to the presence of hydrothermal copper deposits. Radiation patterns have also been known to occur above oil and gas fields, but some of these patterns were thought to be due to surface soils instead of oil and gas.[51]

Answer: Humans can improve their ability to accurately detect deception in an online forum by undergoing training to recognize cues of deception. This involves creating effective training curricula and educational tools, such as a web-based, multimedia training system, to guide individuals in identifying verbal, vocal, and behavioral indicators of deception. Additionally, experiments can be conducted to refine these indicators and evaluate the ability of individuals to judge the veracity of statements both before and after training.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Your appendix — a small pouch connected to your large intestine — can become inflamed and filled with bacteria and pus, resulting in a painful condition called appendicitis. If appendicitis isn’t treated promptly, your infected appendix will rupture, releasing its bacteria into the rest of your abdomen and leading to a potentially life-threatening infection.

Surgery to Treat Appendicitis: Appendectomy

Appendectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the appendix, is the standard treatment for appendicitis. But antibiotics are often used in conjunction with an appendectomy and sometimes instead of the surgery if the case is uncomplicated.

Doctors have been treating appendicitis with appendectomies for more than 100 years. (1)

If you undergo either an open or laparoscopic appendectomy, you can expect to leave the hospital one or two days after surgery (an open appendectomy requires one 2- to 4-inch incision, while a laparoscopic appendectomy requires three small incisions). Some laparoscopic appendectomies are even performed on an outpatient basis. (2) Full recovery is relatively quick (several weeks), and few postoperative complications occur. Most patients don’t need to make lifestyle or diet changes after the operation. (3)



Before conducting an appendectomy, surgeons usually give their patients broad-spectrum antibiotics, which work against a wide range of bacteria. (4)



Antibiotics Used for Treating Appendicitis

The antibiotics used for appendicitis include:

In the case of a ruptured appendix, doctors will prescribe an intravenous (IV) antibiotic to treat abdominal infection — such as peritonitis, a serious infection of the peritoneum membrane that lines your abdominal cavity — after removing your appendix.

Your doctor may decide to follow that up with several weeks of an oral antibiotic that you take at home, but research suggests that three to five days of IV antibiotics are enough. (4)



Doctors often opt for a so-called interval appendectomy if a patient has a ruptured appendix. In this case, you will be treated with several days of IV antibiotics and then may be sent home with an oral antibiotic. Some research has suggested that IV treatment alone in the hospital is sufficient. After an interval of six to eight weeks, if your infection has cleared up, you will undergo an appendectomy.

Are Antibiotics Alone Enough for Appendicitis?

In recent years, some research has suggested that appendectomies aren’t necessary to treat uncomplicated appendicitis, which is appendicitis without a ruptured appendix, pus-filled abscesses, or peritonitis. Instead, an antibiotic-only treatment can do the trick. In clinical trials, patients with uncomplicated appendicitis who were treated only with antibiotics required fewer doses of narcotics, returned to work quicker, and did not have a higher perforation rate than those who underwent an immediate appendectomy. (5)

Although there’s increasing evidence to support this approach in uncomplicated appendicitis, there are nevertheless concerns. Uncomplicated appendicitis can be hard to reliably distinguish from complicated appendicitis, and sometimes the complexity of a case isn’t determined until the time of surgery. (5) And as the American College of Surgeons notes, there’s a higher chance of recurrence with antibiotic-only treatment. (6)



Up to 63 percent of patients who receive antibiotic-only treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis, which comes on quickly, need no additional treatment for at least a year, according to a 2012 study that did an analysis of four controlled trials involving 900 patients. Additionally, antibiotic-only treatment is cheaper than surgery and results in 31 percent fewer complications (though appendectomies already have low complication rates), according to the study. (7)



A 2015 report also found that an “antibiotics first” option may be useful for people who have had complications from prior surgery. However, the report also found that “as many as half the patients so treated will have early treatment failures, and all have a risk of recurrent appendicitis that may ultimately require appendectomy.” (8)



Additionally, the 2012 study noted that about 20 percent of patients who received antibiotic-only treatment suffered from appendicitis again within a year; and 20 percent of those people required treatment for a ruptured appendix and the associated complications on their recurrent appendicitis case. (7)



A separate study from 2015 found a similar failure rate of antibiotic treatment. In patients with uncomplicated appendicitis (as proved by a CT scan), 27 percent required surgical intervention within a year. Still, most patients receiving antibiotic treatment did not require an appendectomy during the one-year follow-up period, and those who required an appendectomy did not experience significant complications. (9)



Against that backdrop, a 2017 review of studies considered whether nonoperative treatment should replace appendectomy as the first-line treatment based on an analysis of the current evidence. The researchers determined that while nonoperative treatment is “definitely a feasible and effective alternative for uncomplicated appendicitis,” appendectomy remains the “gold standard of treatment” for uncomplicated appendicitis due to its higher rate of treatment efficacy. (10)



Additional reporting by Deborah Shapiro
Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis should be given in conjunction with surgery for suspected appendicitis. Antibiotics should be stopped after surgery in patients without perforation. In patients with suspected appendicitis who do not undergo surgery, antimicrobial therapy should be administered for at least 3 days, until clinical symptoms and signs of infection resolve. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Children with uncomplicated appendicitis, without perforation, should receive preoperative, broad-spectrum antibiotics.  For pediatric ruptured appendicitis, subcutaneous antibiotic powder and intravenous (IV) antibiotics can be effective prophylaxis for postoperative intra-abdominal abscess after open appendectomy.  ​

Antibiotic options in acute appendicitis in those at low risk for adverse outcomes who have community-acquired infection include the following  :

Monotherapy: Ertapenem, moxifloxacin

Answer: Antibiotic-only treatment for acute appendicitis is considered appropriate in cases of uncomplicated appendicitis. Uncomplicated appendicitis is defined as appendicitis without a ruptured appendix, pus-filled abscesses, or peritonitis. In these cases, research has suggested that antibiotic-only treatment can be effective, with patients requiring fewer doses of narcotics, returning to work quicker, and not having a higher perforation rate compared to those who undergo an immediate appendectomy. However, there are concerns about the difficulty in reliably distinguishing uncomplicated from complicated appendicitis and the higher chance of recurrence with antibiotic-only treatment.

Three Stages

Brittanica:

"He described human societies as passing through stages of growth and decay. The first is a “bestial” condition, from which emerges “the age of the gods,” in which man is ruled by fear of the supernatural. “The age of heroes” is the consequence of alliances formed by family leaders to protect against internal dissent and external attack; in this stage, society is rigidly divided into patricians and plebeians. “The age of men” follows, as the result of class conflict in which the plebeians achieve equal rights, but this stage encounters the problems of corruption, dissolution, and a possible reversion to primitive barbarism. Vico affirmed that Providence must right the course of history so that humanity is not engulfed in successive cataclysms.

According to Vico, the origin of unequal social classes, which often retain the rigidity of primitive castes, must be attributed to imperfect forms of religion, not to technological progress. All of Vico’s anthropology
Answer: Giambattista Vico viewed history as both "ideal" and "eternal." He believed that history is never perfectly actualized but reflects a divine order or Providence guiding the development of human institutions. Vico proposed that nations pass through distinct stages, which he called "corsi": the ages of gods, heroes, and men. These stages are characterized by specific manifestations of natural law, languages, governments, and systems of jurisprudence. Vico also described human societies as progressing through stages of growth and decay, starting from a "bestial" condition to the "age of the gods," followed by the "age of heroes," and finally the "age of men." He emphasized that Providence must guide history to prevent humanity from falling into successive cataclysms. Vico attributed the origin of unequal social classes to imperfect forms of religion rather than technological progress.

Answer: Giambattista Vico viewed history as both "ideal" and "eternal." He believed that history is never perfectly actualized but reflects a divine order or Providence guiding the development of human institutions. Vico proposed that nations pass through distinct stages, known as "corsi," which include the ages of gods, heroes, and men. Each stage is characterized by specific manifestations of natural law, languages, governments, and systems of jurisprudence. Vico also described human societies as progressing through stages of growth and decay, starting from a "bestial" condition to the "age of the gods," followed by the "age of heroes," and finally the "age of men." He emphasized that Providence plays a role in ensuring that humanity does not fall into successive cataclysms.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  https://kidshealth.org/en/kids/5-seconds.html

What's the 5-Second Rule?

Almost everyone has dropped some food on the floor and still wanted to eat it. If someone saw you drop it, he or she might have yelled, "5-second rule!" This so-called rule says food is OK to eat if you pick it up in 5 seconds or less.

So, Is it True?

Believe it or not, scientists have tested the rule. We're sorry to report it's not necessarily true. Bacteria can attach itself to your food even if you pick it up super-fast. But will your dropped food contain enough bacteria to make you sick? It's possible — and that's why you shouldn't eat food that has hit the floor.

Here's what you need to know about the 5-second rule:
 http://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/danger-zone-40f-140f

in containers on ice.

Cooking

Raw meat and poultry should always be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature (see graphic). When roasting meat and poultry, use an oven temperature no lower than 325 °F.

If you aren't going to serve hot food right away, it's important to keep it at 140 °F or above.

Storing Leftovers

One of the most common causes of foodborne illness is improper cooling of cooked foods. Bacteria can be reintroduced to food after it is safely cooked. For this reason leftovers must be put in shallow containers for quick cooling and refrigerated at 40 °F or below within two hours.

Reheating

Foods should be reheated thoroughly to an internal temperature of 165 °F or until hot and steaming. In the microwave oven, cover food and rotate so it heats evenly.
Answer: No, it is not safe to eat. The 5-second rule is not necessarily true, as bacteria can attach to food even if it is picked up quickly. Therefore, you should not eat food that has hit the floor, including a chicken leg that falls to the floor for 4 seconds.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: What is acute lymphoblastic leukemia?

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer that affects the white blood cells. These cells fight infection and help protect the body against disease.

Patients with ALL have too many immature white blood cells in their bone marrow. These cells crowd out normal white blood cells. Without enough normal white blood cells, the body has a harder time fighting infections.

ALL affects a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes, causing them to build up in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes.

How common is acute lymphoblastic leukemia?

ALL is the most common type of childhood cancer. It most often occurs in children ages 3 to 5 and affects slightly more boys than girls. ALL is most common in Hispanic children, followed by those of white and African-American descent.

About 3,000 people younger than age 20 are found to have ALL each year in the United States.

Siblings of children with leukemia have a slightly higher risk of developing ALL, but the rate is still quite low: no more than 1 in 500.
Key Points There are different types of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Children with ALL should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood leukemia.

The treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases.

Four types of standard treatment are used: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy

Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles.

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Immunotherapy

Treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia may cause side effects.

Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Follow-up tests may be needed.

There are different types of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Different types of treatment are available for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

The treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases. The treatment of childhood ALL is done in phases: Remission induction: This is the first phase of treatment. The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This puts the leukemia into remission.

Consolidation/intensification: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins once the leukemia is in remission. The goal of consolidation/intensification therapy is to kill any leukemia cells that remain in the body and may cause a relapse.

Maintenance: This is the third phase of treatment. The goal is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse. Often the cancer treatments are given in lower doses than those used during the remission induction and consolidation/intensification phases. Not taking medication as ordered by the doctor during maintenance therapy increases the chance the cancer will come back. This is also called the continuation therapy phase.

Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles. Treatment to kill leukemia cells or prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system; CNS) is called CNS-directed therapy. Chemotherapy may be used to treat leukemia cells that have spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord. Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not cross the blood-brain barrier to get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord to reach the leukemia cells in the CNS, the cells are able to hide in the CNS. Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses or intrathecal chemotherapy (into the cerebrospinal fluid) is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. Sometimes external radiation therapy to the brain is also given. Enlarge Intrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed. These treatments are given in addition to treatment that is used to kill leukemia cells in the rest of the body. All children with ALL receive CNS-directed therapy as part of induction therapy and consolidation/intensification therapy and sometimes during maintenance therapy. If the leukemia cells spread to the testicles, treatment includes high doses of systemic chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy.

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of biologic therapy. CAR T-cell therapy: This treatment changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed (come back) a second time. Enlarge CAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.

Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Answer: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells, specifically a type called lymphocytes. In ALL, there are too many immature white blood cells in the bone marrow, which crowd out normal white blood cells. This can make it harder for the body to fight infections. ALL is the most common type of childhood cancer, most often occurring in children ages 3 to 5, and is slightly more common in boys than girls. It is most prevalent among Hispanic children, followed by those of white and African-American descent.

The prognosis for ALL can vary depending on several factors, including the child's age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, and response to treatment. Treatment for childhood ALL typically involves three phases: remission induction, consolidation/intensification, and maintenance. Standard treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy with stem cell transplant, and targeted therapy. New treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also being tested in clinical trials. The prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate treatment, but it is important to follow the treatment plan and consider clinical trials as an option.

The goal is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse. Often the cancer treatments are given in lower doses than those used during the remission induction and consolidation/intensification phases. Not taking medication as ordered by the doctor during maintenance therapy increases the chance the cancer will come back. This is also called the continuation therapy phase.\\n\\nTreatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles. Treatment to kill leukemia cells or prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system; CNS) is called CNS-directed therapy. Chemotherapy may be used to treat leukemia cells that have spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord. Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not cross the blood-brain barrier to get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord to reach the leukemia cells in the CNS, the cells are able to hide in the CNS. Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses or intrathecal chemotherapy (into the cerebrospinal fluid) is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. Sometimes external radiation therapy to the brain is also given. Enlarge Intrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed. These treatments are given in addition to treatment that is used to kill leukemia cells in the rest of the body. All children with ALL receive CNS-directed therapy as part of induction therapy and consolidation/intensification therapy and sometimes during maintenance therapy. If the leukemia cells spread to the testicles, treatment includes high doses of systemic chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy.\\n\\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of biologic therapy. CAR T-cell therapy: This treatment changes the patient\'s T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient\'s blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed (come back) a second time. Enlarge CAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\\n\\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today\'s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n\\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.", \'embedding\': None}', metadata={'score': 0.8386764526367188, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:4745'})]
Answer: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells, specifically lymphocytes, which are crucial for fighting infections and protecting the body against disease. In ALL, there is an overproduction of immature white blood cells in the bone marrow, which crowds out normal white blood cells, making it harder for the body to fight infections. ALL is the most common type of childhood cancer, particularly affecting children aged 3 to 5, and is slightly more common in boys than girls. 

The prognosis for ALL can vary depending on several factors, including the child's age, the specific characteristics of the leukemia, and how well the leukemia responds to treatment. Treatment for childhood ALL typically involves three phases: remission induction, consolidation/intensification, and maintenance. Standard treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy with stem cell transplant, and targeted therapy. New treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also being tested in clinical trials. Participation in clinical trials may be considered to access new treatments and contribute to research. It's important to discuss the specific prognosis and treatment options with your child's healthcare team, who can provide guidance based on the individual case.
RAG Score: 99
GraphRAG Score: 99Question: What is the most efficient searching algorithm you can use, while programming in C++?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N).

Conditions for when to apply Binary Search in a Data Structure:

To apply Binary Search algorithm:

The data structure must be sorted.

Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time.

Binary Search Algorithm:

In this algorithm, Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index “mid” . Compare the middle element of the search space with the key.

If the key is found at middle element, the process is terminated.

If the key is not found at middle element, choose which half will be used as the next search space. If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used for next search. If the key is larger than the middle element, then the right side is used for next search.

This process is continued until the key is found or the total search space is exhausted.

How does Binary Search work?

To understand the working of binary search, consider the following illustration:

Consider an array arr[] = {2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91}, and the target = 23. First Step: Calculate the mid and compare the mid element with the key. If the key is less than mid element, move to left and if it is greater than the mid then move search space to the right. Key (i.e., 23) is greater than current mid element (i.e., 16). The search space moves to the right. Key is less than the current mid 56. The search space moves to the left. Second Step: If the key matches the value of the mid element, the element is found and stop search.

How to Implement Binary Search?

The Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in the following two ways

Iterative Binary Search Algorithm

Recursive Binary Search Algorithm

Given below are the pseudocodes for the approaches.

1. Iterative Binary Search Algorithm:

Here we use a while loop to continue the process of comparing the key and splitting the search space in two halves.

Implementation of Iterative Binary Search Algorithm:

C++





#include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; int binarySearch( int arr[], int l, int r, int x) { while (l <= r) { int m = l + (r - l) / 2; if (arr[m] == x) return m; if (arr[m] < x) l = m + 1; else r = m - 1; } return -1; } int main( void ) { int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 }; int x = 10; int n = sizeof (arr) / sizeof (arr); int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x); (result == -1) ? cout << "Element is not present in array" : cout << "Element is present at index " << result; return 0; } C





#include <stdio.h> int binarySearch( int arr[], int l, int r, int x) { while (l <= r) { int m = l + (r - l) / 2; if (arr[m] == x) return m; if (arr[m] < x) l = m + 1; else r = m - 1; } return -1; } int main( void ) { int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 }; int n = sizeof (arr) / sizeof (arr); int x = 10; int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x); (result == -1) ? printf ( "Element is not present" " in array" ) : printf ( "Element is present at " "index %d" , result); return 0; } Java





import java.io.*; class BinarySearch { int binarySearch( int arr[], int x) { int l = 0 , r = arr.length - 1 ; while (l <= r) { int m = l + (r - l) / 2 ; if (arr[m] == x) return m; if (arr[m] < x) l = m + 1 ; else r = m - 1 ; } return - 1 ; } public static void main(String args[]) { BinarySearch ob = new BinarySearch(); int arr[] = { 2 , 3 , 4 , 10 , 40 }; int n = arr.length; int x = 10 ; int result = ob.binarySearch(arr, x); if (result == - 1 ) System.out.println( "Element is not present in array" ); else System.out.println( "Element is present at " + "index " + result); } } Python3





def binarySearch(arr, l, r, x): while l < = r: mid = l + (r - l) / / 2 if arr[mid] = = x: return mid elif arr[mid] < x: l = mid + 1 else : r = mid - 1 return - 1 if __name__ = = '__main__' : arr = [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 10 , 40 ] x = 10 result = binarySearch(arr, 0 , len (arr) - 1 , x) if result ! = - 1 : print ( "Element is present at index" , result) else : print ( "Element is not present in array" ) C#





using System; class GFG { static int binarySearch( int [] arr, int x) { int l = 0, r = arr.Length - 1; while (l <= r) { int m = l + (r - l) / 2; if (arr[m] == x) return m; if (arr[m] < x) l = m + 1; else r = m - 1; } return -1; } public static void Main() { int [] arr = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 }; int n = arr.Length; int x = 10; int result = binarySearch(arr, x); if (result == -1) Console.WriteLine( "Element is not present in array" ); else Console.WriteLine( "Element is present at " + "index " + result); } } Javascript





function binarySearch(arr, x) { let l = 0; let r = arr.length - 1; let mid; while (r >= l) { mid = l + Math.floor((r - l) / 2); if (arr[mid] == x) return mid; if (arr[mid] > x) r = mid - 1; else l = mid + 1; } return -1; } arr = new Array(2, 3, 4, 10, 40); x = 10; n = arr.length; result = binarySearch(arr, x); (result == -1) ? console.log( "Element is not present in array" ) : console.log ( "Element is present at index " + result); PHP





<?php function binarySearch( $arr , $l , $r , $x ) { while ( $l <= $r ) { $m = $l + ( $r - $l ) / 2; if ( $arr [ $m ] == $x ) return floor ( $m ); if ( $arr [ $m ] < $x ) $l = $m + 1; else $r = $m - 1; } return -1; } $arr = array (2, 3, 4, 10, 40); $n = count ( $arr ); $x = 10; $result = binarySearch( $arr , 0, $n - 1, $x ); if (( $result == -1)) echo "Element is not present in array" ; else echo "Element is present at index " , $result ; ?>

Output Element is present at index 3

Time Complexity: O(log N)

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

2. Recursive Binary Search Algorithm:

Create a recursive function and compare the mid of the search space with the key. And based on the result either return the index where the key is found or call the recursive function for the next search space.

Implementation of Recursive Binary Search Algorithm:

C++





#include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; int binarySearch( int arr[], int l, int r, int x) { if (r >= l) { int mid = l + (r - l) / 2; if (arr[mid] == x) return mid; if (arr[mid] > x) return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x); return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x); } return -1; } int main() { int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 }; int x = 10; int n = sizeof (arr) / sizeof (arr); int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x); (result == -1) ? cout << "Element is not present in array" : cout << "Element is present at index " << result; return 0; } C





#include <stdio.h> int binarySearch( int arr[], int l, int r, int x) { if (r >= l) { int mid = l + (r - l) / 2; if (arr[mid] == x) return mid; if (arr[mid] > x) return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x); return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x); } return -1; } int main() { int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 }; int n = sizeof (arr) / sizeof (arr); int x = 10; int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x); (result == -1) ? printf ( "Element is not present in array" ) : printf ( "Element is present at index %d" , result); return 0; } Java





class BinarySearch { int binarySearch( int arr[], int l, int r, int x) { if (r >= l) { int mid = l + (r - l) / 2 ; if (arr[mid] == x) return mid; if (arr[mid] > x) return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1 , x); return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1 , r, x); } return - 1 ; } public static void main(String args[]) { BinarySearch ob = new BinarySearch(); int arr[] = { 2 , 3 , 4 , 10 , 40 }; int n = arr.length; int x = 10 ; int result = ob.binarySearch(arr, 0 , n - 1 , x); if (result == - 1 ) System.out.println( "Element is not present in array" ); else System.out.println( "Element is present at index " + result); } } Python3





def binarySearch(arr, l, r, x): if r > = l: mid = l + (r - l) / / 2 if arr[mid] = = x: return mid elif arr[mid] > x: return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1 , x) else : return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1 , r, x) else : return - 1 if __name__ = = '__main__' : arr = [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 10 , 40 ] x = 10 result = binarySearch(arr, 0 , len (arr) - 1 , x) if result ! = - 1 : print ( "Element is present at index" , result) else : print ( "Element is not present in array" ) C#

Output Element is present at index 3

Time Complexity: Best Case: O(1) Average Case: O(log N) Worst Case: O(log N)

Auxiliary Space: O(1), If the recursive call stack is considered then the auxiliary space will be O(logN).

Advantages of Binary Search:

Binary search is faster than linear search, especially for large arrays.

More efficient than other searching algorithms with a similar time complexity, such as interpolation search or exponential search.

Binary search is well-suited for searching large datasets that are stored in external memory, such as on a hard drive or in the cloud.

Drawbacks of Binary Search:

The array should be sorted.

Binary search requires that the data structure being searched be stored in contiguous memory locations.

Binary search requires that the elements of the array be comparable, meaning that they must be able to be ordered.

Applications of Binary Search:
This article is about searching a finite sorted array. For searching continuous function values, see bisection method

Search algorithm finding the position of a target value within a sorted array

In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making O ( log ⁡ n ) O(\log n) comparisons, where n n is the number of elements in the array.[a] Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables, that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.

There are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in computational geometry and in numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.

Algorithm [ edit ]

Binary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration.

Procedure [ edit ]

Given an array A A of n n elements with values or records A 0 , A 1 , A 2 , … , A n − 1 {\displaystyle A_{0},A_{1},A_{2},\ldots ,A_{n-1}} sorted such that A 0 ≤ A 1 ≤ A 2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ A n − 1 {\displaystyle A_{0}\leq A_{1}\leq A_{2}\leq \cdots \leq A_{n-1}} , and target value T T , the following subroutine uses binary search to find the index of T T in A A .

Set L L 0 0 R R n − 1 n-1 If L > R {\displaystyle L>R} Set m m floor of L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} If A m < T {\displaystyle A_{m}<T} L L m + 1 m+1 If A m > T {\displaystyle A_{m}>T} R R m − 1 m-1 Now A m = T {\displaystyle A_{m}=T} m m

This iterative procedure keeps track of the search boundaries with the two variables L L and R R . The procedure may be expressed in pseudocode as follows, where the variable names and types remain the same as above, floor is the floor function, and unsuccessful refers to a specific value that conveys the failure of the search.

function binary_search(A, n, T) is L := 0 R := n − 1 while L ≤ R do m := floor((L + R) / 2) if A[m] < T then L := m + 1 else if A[m] > T then R := m − 1 else: return m return unsuccessful

Alternatively, the algorithm may take the ceiling of L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} . This may change the result if the target value appears more than once in the array.

Alternative procedure [ edit ]

In the above procedure, the algorithm checks whether the middle element ( m m ) is equal to the target ( T T ) in every iteration. Some implementations leave out this check during each iteration. The algorithm would perform this check only when one element is left (when L = R {\displaystyle L=R} ). This results in a faster comparison loop, as one comparison is eliminated per iteration, while it requires only one more iteration on average.

Hermann Bottenbruch published the first implementation to leave out this check in 1962.

Set L L 0 0 R R n − 1 n-1 While L ≠ R {\displaystyle L

eq R} Set m m ceiling of L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} If A m > T {\displaystyle A_{m}>T} R R m − 1 m-1 Else, A m ≤ T {\displaystyle A_{m}\leq T} L L m m Now L = R {\displaystyle L=R} A L = T {\displaystyle A_{L}=T} L L

Where ceil is the ceiling function, the pseudocode for this version is:

function binary_search_alternative(A, n, T) is L := 0 R := n − 1 while L != R do m := ceil((L + R) / 2) if A[m] > T then R := m − 1 else: L := m if A[L] = T then return L return unsuccessful

Duplicate elements [ edit ]

The procedure may return any index whose element is equal to the target value, even if there are duplicate elements in the array. For example, if the array to be searched was [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] {\displaystyle [1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7]} and the target was 4 4 , then it would be correct for the algorithm to either return the 4th (index 3) or 5th (index 4) element. The regular procedure would return the 4th element (index 3) in this case. It does not always return the first duplicate (consider [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] {\displaystyle [1,2,4,4,4,5,6,7]} which still returns the 4th element). However, it is sometimes necessary to find the leftmost element or the rightmost element for a target value that is duplicated in the array. In the above example, the 4th element is the leftmost element of the value 4, while the 5th element is the rightmost element of the value 4. The alternative procedure above will always return the index of the rightmost element if such an element exists.

Procedure for finding the leftmost element [ edit ]

To find the leftmost element, the following procedure can be used:

Set L L 0 0 R R n n While L < R {\displaystyle L<R} Set m m floor of L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} If A m < T {\displaystyle A_{m}<T} L L m + 1 m+1 Else, A m ≥ T {\displaystyle A_{m}\geq T} R R to m m Return L L

If L < n {\displaystyle L<n} and A L = T {\displaystyle A_{L}=T} , then A L A_{L} is the leftmost element that equals T T . Even if T T is not in the array, L L is the rank of T T in the array, or the number of elements in the array that are less than T T .

Where floor is the floor function, the pseudocode for this version is:

function binary_search_leftmost(A, n, T): L := 0 R := n while L < R: m := floor((L + R) / 2) if A[m] < T: L := m + 1 else: R := m return L

Procedure for finding the rightmost element [ edit ]

To find the rightmost element, the following procedure can be used:

Set L L 0 0 R R n n While L < R {\displaystyle L<R} Set m m floor of L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} If A m > T {\displaystyle A_{m}>T} R R m m Else, A m ≤ T {\displaystyle A_{m}\leq T} L L to m + 1 m+1 Return R − 1 {\displaystyle R-1}

If R > 0 R>0 and A R − 1 = T {\displaystyle A_{R-1}=T} , then A R − 1 {\displaystyle A_{R-1}} is the rightmost element that equals T T . Even if T T is not in the array, n − R {\displaystyle n-R} is the number of elements in the array that are greater than T T .

Where floor is the floor function, the pseudocode for this version is:

function binary_search_rightmost(A, n, T): L := 0 R := n while L < R: m := floor((L + R) / 2) if A[m] > T: R := m else: L := m + 1 return R - 1

Approximate matches [ edit ]

Binary search can be adapted to compute approximate matches. In the example above, the rank, predecessor, successor, and nearest neighbor are shown for the target value 5 5

The above procedure only performs exact matches, finding the position of a target value. However, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches because binary search operates on sorted arrays. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.

Rank queries can be performed with the procedure for finding the leftmost element. The number of elements less than the target value is returned by the procedure.

the target value is returned by the procedure. Predecessor queries can be performed with rank queries. If the rank of the target value is r r r − 1 r-1

For successor queries, the procedure for finding the rightmost element can be used. If the result of running the procedure for the target value is r r , then the successor of the target value is r + 1 r+1

, then the successor of the target value is The nearest neighbor of the target value is either its predecessor or successor, whichever is closer.

Range queries are also straightforward. Once the ranks of the two values are known, the number of elements greater than or equal to the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether the array contains entries matching those endpoints.

Performance [ edit ]

A tree representing binary search. The array being searched here is [ 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 80 , 90 , 100 ] {\displaystyle [20,30,40,50,80,90,100]} 40 {\displaystyle 40}

The worst case is reached when the search reaches the deepest level of the tree, while the best case is reached when the target value is the middle element.

In terms of the number of comparisons, the performance of binary search can be analyzed by viewing the run of the procedure on a binary tree. The root node of the tree is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root, and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. Starting from the root node, the left or right subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration.

In the worst case, binary search makes ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) + 1 ⌋ {\textstyle \lfloor \log _{2}(n)+1\rfloor } iterations of the comparison loop, where the ⌊ ⌋ {\textstyle \lfloor \rfloor } notation denotes the floor function that yields the greatest integer less than or equal to the argument, and log 2 {\textstyle \log _{2}} is the binary logarithm. This is because the worst case is reached when the search reaches the deepest level of the tree, and there are always ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) + 1 ⌋ {\textstyle \lfloor \log _{2}(n)+1\rfloor } levels in the tree for any binary search.

The worst case may also be reached when the target element is not in the array. If n {\textstyle n} is one less than a power of two, then this is always the case. Otherwise, the search may perform ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) + 1 ⌋ {\textstyle \lfloor \log _{2}(n)+1\rfloor } iterations if the search reaches the deepest level of the tree. However, it may make ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ {\textstyle \lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor } iterations, which is one less than the worst case, if the search ends at the second-deepest level of the tree.

On average, assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, binary search makes ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 1 − ( 2 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 1 − ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ − 2 ) / n {\displaystyle \lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +1-(2^{\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +1}-\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor -2)/n} iterations when the target element is in the array. This is approximately equal to log 2 ⁡ ( n ) − 1 {\displaystyle \log _{2}(n)-1} iterations. When the target element is not in the array, binary search makes ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 2 − 2 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 1 / ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle \lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +2-2^{\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +1}/(n+1)} iterations on average, assuming that the range between and outside elements is equally likely to be searched.

In the best case, where the target value is the middle element of the array, its position is returned after one iteration.

In terms of iterations, no search algorithm that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst-case performance than binary search. The comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as every level above the lowest level of the tree is filled completely.[b] Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, increasing the number of iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is worse than binary search. By dividing the array in half, binary search ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.

Space complexity [ edit ]

Binary search requires three pointers to elements, which may be array indices or pointers to memory locations, regardless of the size of the array. Therefore, the space complexity of binary search is O ( 1 ) O(1) in the word RAM model of computation.

Derivation of average case [ edit ]

The average number of iterations performed by binary search depends on the probability of each element being searched. The average case is different for successful searches and unsuccessful searches. It will be assumed that each element is equally likely to be searched for successful searches. For unsuccessful searches, it will be assumed that the intervals between and outside elements are equally likely to be searched. The average case for successful searches is the number of iterations required to search every element exactly once, divided by n n , the number of elements. The average case for unsuccessful searches is the number of iterations required to search an element within every interval exactly once, divided by the n + 1 n+1 intervals.

Successful searches [ edit ]

In the binary tree representation, a successful search can be represented by a path from the root to the target node, called an internal path. The length of a path is the number of edges (connections between nodes) that the path passes through. The number of iterations performed by a search, given that the corresponding path has length l l , is l + 1 {\displaystyle l+1} counting the initial iteration. The internal path length is the sum of the lengths of all unique internal paths. Since there is only one path from the root to any single node, each internal path represents a search for a specific element. If there are n n elements, which is a positive integer, and the internal path length is I ( n ) I(n) , then the average number of iterations for a successful search T ( n ) = 1 + I ( n ) n {\displaystyle T(n)=1+{\frac {I(n)}{n}}} , with the one iteration added to count the initial iteration.

Since binary search is the optimal algorithm for searching with comparisons, this problem is reduced to calculating the minimum internal path length of all binary trees with n n nodes, which is equal to:

I ( n ) = ∑ k = 1 n ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( k ) ⌋ {\displaystyle I(n)=\sum _{k=1}^{n}\left\lfloor \log _{2}(k)\right\rfloor }

For example, in a 7-element array, the root requires one iteration, the two elements below the root require two iterations, and the four elements below require three iterations. In this case, the internal path length is:

∑ k = 1 7 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( k ) ⌋ = 0 + 2 ( 1 ) + 4 ( 2 ) = 2 + 8 = 10 {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{7}\left\lfloor \log _{2}(k)\right\rfloor =0+2(1)+4(2)=2+8=10}

The average number of iterations would be 1 + 10 7 = 2 3 7 {\displaystyle 1+{\frac {10}{7}}=2{\frac {3}{7}}} based on the equation for the average case. The sum for I ( n ) I(n) can be simplified to:

I ( n ) = ∑ k = 1 n ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( k ) ⌋ = ( n + 1 ) ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n + 1 ) ⌋ − 2 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n + 1 ) ⌋ + 1 + 2 {\displaystyle I(n)=\sum _{k=1}^{n}\left\lfloor \log _{2}(k)\right\rfloor =(n+1)\left\lfloor \log _{2}(n+1)\right\rfloor -2^{\left\lfloor \log _{2}(n+1)\right\rfloor +1}+2}

Substituting the equation for I ( n ) I(n) into the equation for T ( n ) T(n) :

T ( n ) = 1 + ( n + 1 ) ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n + 1 ) ⌋ − 2 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n + 1 ) ⌋ + 1 + 2 n = ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 1 − ( 2 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 1 − ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ − 2 ) / n {\displaystyle T(n)=1+{\frac {(n+1)\left\lfloor \log _{2}(n+1)\right\rfloor -2^{\left\lfloor \log _{2}(n+1)\right\rfloor +1}+2}{n}}=\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +1-(2^{\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +1}-\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor -2)/n}

For integer n n , this is equivalent to the equation for the average case on a successful search specified above.

Unsuccessful searches [ edit ]

Unsuccessful searches can be represented by augmenting the tree with external nodes, which forms an extended binary tree. If an internal node, or a node present in the tree, has fewer than two child nodes, then additional child nodes, called external nodes, are added so that each internal node has two children. By doing so, an unsuccessful search can be represented as a path to an external node, whose parent is the single element that remains during the last iteration. An external path is a path from the root to an external node. The external path length is the sum of the lengths of all unique external paths. If there are n n elements, which is a positive integer, and the external path length is E ( n ) E(n) , then the average number of iterations for an unsuccessful search T ′ ( n ) = E ( n ) n + 1 {\displaystyle T'(n)={\frac {E(n)}{n+1}}} , with the one iteration added to count the initial iteration. The external path length is divided by n + 1 n+1 instead of n n because there are n + 1 n+1 external paths, representing the intervals between and outside the elements of the array.

This problem can similarly be reduced to determining the minimum external path length of all binary trees with n n nodes. For all binary trees, the external path length is equal to the internal path length plus 2 n 2n . Substituting the equation for I ( n ) I(n) :

E ( n ) = I ( n ) + 2 n = [ ( n + 1 ) ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n + 1 ) ⌋ − 2 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n + 1 ) ⌋ + 1 + 2 ] + 2 n = ( n + 1 ) ( ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 2 ) − 2 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 1 {\displaystyle E(n)=I(n)+2n=\left[(n+1)\left\lfloor \log _{2}(n+1)\right\rfloor -2^{\left\lfloor \log _{2}(n+1)\right\rfloor +1}+2\right]+2n=(n+1)(\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +2)-2^{\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +1}}

Substituting the equation for E ( n ) E(n) into the equation for T ′ ( n ) {\displaystyle T'(n)} , the average case for unsuccessful searches can be determined:

T ′ ( n ) = ( n + 1 ) ( ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 2 ) − 2 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 1 ( n + 1 ) = ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 2 − 2 ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) ⌋ + 1 / ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle T'(n)={\frac {(n+1)(\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +2)-2^{\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +1}}{(n+1)}}=\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +2-2^{\lfloor \log _{2}(n)\rfloor +1}/(n+1)}

Performance of alternative procedure [ edit ]

Each iteration of the binary search procedure defined above makes one or two comparisons, checking if the middle element is equal to the target in each iteration. Assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, each iteration makes 1.5 comparisons on average. A variation of the algorithm checks whether the middle element is equal to the target at the end of the search. On average, this eliminates half a comparison from each iteration. This slightly cuts the time taken per iteration on most computers. However, it guarantees that the search takes the maximum number of iterations, on average adding one iteration to the search. Because the comparison loop is performed only ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ( n ) + 1 ⌋ {\textstyle \lfloor \log _{2}(n)+1\rfloor } times in the worst case, the slight increase in efficiency per iteration does not compensate for the extra iteration for all but very large n {\textstyle n} .[c][19]

Running time and cache use [ edit ]

In analyzing the performance of binary search, another consideration is the time required to compare two elements. For integers and strings, the time required increases linearly as the encoding length (usually the number of bits) of the elements increase. For example, comparing a pair of 64-bit unsigned integers would require comparing up to double the bits as comparing a pair of 32-bit unsigned integers. The worst case is achieved when the integers are equal. This can be significant when the encoding lengths of the elements are large, such as with large integer types or long strings, which makes comparing elements expensive. Furthermore, comparing floating-point values (the most common digital representation of real numbers) is often more expensive than comparing integers or short strings.

On most computer architectures, the processor has a hardware cache separate from RAM. Since they are located within the processor itself, caches are much faster to access but usually store much less data than RAM. Therefore, most processors store memory locations that have been accessed recently, along with memory locations close to it. For example, when an array element is accessed, the element itself may be stored along with the elements that are stored close to it in RAM, making it faster to sequentially access array elements that are close in index to each other (locality of reference). On a sorted array, binary search can jump to distant memory locations if the array is large, unlike algorithms (such as linear search and linear probing in hash tables) which access elements in sequence. This adds slightly to the running time of binary search for large arrays on most systems.[20]

Binary search versus other schemes [ edit ]

Sorted arrays with binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval, taking O ( n ) {\textstyle O(n)} time for each such operation. In addition, sorted arrays can complicate memory use especially when elements are often inserted into the array. There are other data structures that support much more efficient insertion and deletion. Binary search can be used to perform exact matching and set membership (determining whether a target value is in a collection of values). There are data structures that support faster exact matching and set membership. However, unlike many other searching schemes, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching, usually performing such matches in O ( log ⁡ n ) {\textstyle O(\log n)} time regardless of the type or structure of the values themselves.[22] In addition, there are some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, that can be performed efficiently on a sorted array.

Linear search [ edit ]

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short, although the array needs to be sorted beforehand.[d] All sorting algorithms based on comparing elements, such as quicksort and merge sort, require at least O ( n log ⁡ n ) {\textstyle O(n\log n)} comparisons in the worst case. Unlike linear search, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching. There are operations such as finding the smallest and largest element that can be done efficiently on a sorted array but not on an unsorted array.

Trees [ edit ]

Binary search trees are searched using an algorithm similar to binary search.

A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure that works based on the principle of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary search trees. This can be faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.[22]

However, binary search is usually more efficient for searching as binary search trees will most likely be imperfectly balanced, resulting in slightly worse performance than binary search. This even applies to balanced binary search trees, binary search trees that balance their own nodes, because they rarely produce the tree with the fewest possible levels. Except for balanced binary search trees, the tree may be severely imbalanced with few internal nodes with two children, resulting in the average and worst-case search time approaching n {\textstyle n} comparisons.[e] Binary search trees take more space than sorted arrays.

Binary search trees lend themselves to fast searching in external memory stored in hard disks, as binary search trees can be efficiently structured in filesystems. The B-tree generalizes this method of tree organization. B-trees are frequently used to organize long-term storage such as databases and filesystems.

Hashing [ edit ]

For implementing associative arrays, hash tables, a data structure that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records. Most hash table implementations require only amortized constant time on average.[f][34] However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, as the only information given on a failed search is that the target is not present in any record.[35] Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. Binary search also supports approximate matches. Some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, can be done efficiently on sorted arrays but not on hash tables.[22]

Set membership algorithms [ edit ]

A related problem to search is set membership. Any algorithm that does lookup, like binary search, can also be used for set membership. There are other algorithms that are more specifically suited for set membership. A bit array is the simplest, useful when the range of keys is limited. It compactly stores a collection of bits, with each bit representing a single key within the range of keys. Bit arrays are very fast, requiring only O ( 1 ) {\textstyle O(1)} time. The Judy1 type of Judy array handles 64-bit keys efficiently.[37]

For approximate results, Bloom filters, another probabilistic data structure based on hashing, store a set of keys by encoding the keys using a bit array and multiple hash functions. Bloom filters are much more space-efficient than bit arrays in most cases and not much slower: with k {\textstyle k} hash functions, membership queries require only O ( k ) {\textstyle O(k)} time. However, Bloom filters suffer from false positives.[g][h][39]

Other data structures [ edit ]

There exist data structures that may improve on binary search in some cases for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute.[22] As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.[37]

Variations [ edit ]

Uniform binary search [ edit ]

Uniform binary search stores the difference between the current and the two next possible middle elements instead of specific bounds.

Uniform binary search stores, instead of the lower and upper bounds, the difference in the index of the middle element from the current iteration to the next iteration. A lookup table containing the differences is computed beforehand. For example, if the array to be searched is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], the middle element ( m m ) would be 6. In this case, the middle element of the left subarray ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is 3 and the middle element of the right subarray ([7, 8, 9, 10, 11]) is 9. Uniform binary search would store the value of 3 as both indices differ from 6 by this same amount. To reduce the search space, the algorithm either adds or subtracts this change from the index of the middle element. Uniform binary search may be faster on systems where it is inefficient to calculate the midpoint, such as on decimal computers.

Exponential search [ edit ]

Visualization of exponential searching finding the upper bound for the subsequent binary search

Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. It starts by finding the first element with an index that is both a power of two and greater than the target value. Afterwards, it sets that index as the upper bound, and switches to binary search. A search takes ⌊ log 2 ⁡ x + 1 ⌋ {\textstyle \lfloor \log _{2}x+1\rfloor } iterations before binary search is started and at most ⌊ log 2 ⁡ x ⌋ {\textstyle \lfloor \log _{2}x\rfloor } iterations of the binary search, where x {\textstyle x} is the position of the target value. Exponential search works on bounded lists, but becomes an improvement over binary search only if the target value lies near the beginning of the array.

Interpolation search [ edit ]

Visualization of interpolation search using linear interpolation. In this case, no searching is needed because the estimate of the target's location within the array is correct. Other implementations may specify another function for estimating the target's location.

Instead of calculating the midpoint, interpolation search estimates the position of the target value, taking into account the lowest and highest elements in the array as well as length of the array. It works on the basis that the midpoint is not the best guess in many cases. For example, if the target value is close to the highest element in the array, it is likely to be located near the end of the array.

A common interpolation function is linear interpolation. If A A is the array, L , R {\displaystyle L,R} are the lower and upper bounds respectively, and T T is the target, then the target is estimated to be about ( T − A L ) / ( A R − A L ) {\displaystyle (T-A_{L})/(A_{R}-A_{L})} of the way between L L and R R . When linear interpolation is used, and the distribution of the array elements is uniform or near uniform, interpolation search makes O ( log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) {\textstyle O(\log \log n)} comparisons.[45]

In practice, interpolation search is slower than binary search for small arrays, as interpolation search requires extra computation. Its time complexity grows more slowly than binary search, but this only compensates for the extra computation for large arrays.

Fractional cascading [ edit ]

In fractional cascading, each array has pointers to every second element of another array, so only one binary search has to be performed to search all the arrays.

Fractional cascading is a technique that speeds up binary searches for the same element in multiple sorted arrays. Searching each array separately requires O ( k log ⁡ n ) {\textstyle O(k\log n)} time, where k {\textstyle k} is the number of arrays. Fractional cascading reduces this to O ( k + log ⁡ n ) {\textstyle O(k+\log n)} by storing specific information in each array about each element and its position in the other arrays.[46][47]

Fractional cascading was originally developed to efficiently solve various computational geometry problems. Fractional cascading has been applied elsewhere, such as in data mining and Internet Protocol routing.[46]

Generalization to graphs [ edit ]

Binary search has been generalized to work on certain types of graphs, where the target value is stored in a vertex instead of an array element. Binary search trees are one such generalization—when a vertex (node) in the tree is queried, the algorithm either learns that the vertex is the target, or otherwise which subtree the target would be located in. However, this can be further generalized as follows: given an undirected, positively weighted graph and a target vertex, the algorithm learns upon querying a vertex that it is equal to the target, or it is given an incident edge that is on the shortest path from the queried vertex to the target. The standard binary search algorithm is simply the case where the graph is a path. Similarly, binary search trees are the case where the edges to the left or right subtrees are given when the queried vertex is unequal to the target. For all undirected, positively weighted graphs, there is an algorithm that finds the target vertex in O ( log ⁡ n ) O(\log n) queries in the worst case.[48]

Noisy binary search [ edit ]

In noisy binary search, there is a certain probability that a comparison is incorrect.

Noisy binary search algorithms solve the case where the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array. For each pair of elements, there is a certain probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. Every noisy binary search procedure must make at least ( 1 − τ ) log 2 ⁡ ( n ) H ( p ) − 10 H ( p ) {\displaystyle (1-\tau ){\frac {\log _{2}(n)}{H(p)}}-{\frac {10}{H(p)}}} comparisons on average, where H ( p ) = − p log 2 ⁡ ( p ) − ( 1 − p ) log 2 ⁡ ( 1 − p ) {\displaystyle H(p)=-p\log _{2}(p)-(1-p)\log _{2}(1-p)} is the binary entropy function and τ \tau is the probability that the procedure yields the wrong position.[49][50][51] The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game,[52] a variant of Twenty Questions where the answers may be wrong.[53]

Quantum binary search [ edit ]

Classical computers are bounded to the worst case of exactly ⌊ log 2 ⁡ n + 1 ⌋ {\textstyle \lfloor \log _{2}n+1\rfloor } iterations when performing binary search. Quantum algorithms for binary search are still bounded to a proportion of log 2 ⁡ n {\textstyle \log _{2}n} queries (representing iterations of the classical procedure), but the constant factor is less than one, providing for a lower time complexity on quantum computers. Any exact quantum binary search procedure—that is, a procedure that always yields the correct result—requires at least 1 π ( ln ⁡ n − 1 ) ≈ 0.22 log 2 ⁡ n {\textstyle {\frac {1}{\pi }}(\ln n-1)\approx 0.22\log _{2}n} queries in the worst case, where ln {\textstyle \ln } is the natural logarithm.[54] There is an exact quantum binary search procedure that runs in 4 log 605 ⁡ n ≈ 0.433 log 2 ⁡ n {\textstyle 4\log _{605}n\approx 0.433\log _{2}n} queries in the worst case.[55] In comparison, Grover's algorithm is the optimal quantum algorithm for searching an unordered list of elements, and it requires O ( n ) O({\sqrt {n}}) queries.[56]

History [ edit ]

The idea of sorting a list of items to allow for faster searching dates back to antiquity. The earliest known example was the Inakibit-Anu tablet from Babylon dating back to c. 200 BCE. The tablet contained about 500 sexagesimal numbers and their reciprocals sorted in lexicographical order, which made searching for a specific entry easier. In addition, several lists of names that were sorted by their first letter were discovered on the Aegean Islands. Catholicon, a Latin dictionary finished in 1286 CE, was the first work to describe rules for sorting words into alphabetical order, as opposed to just the first few letters.

In 1946, John Mauchly made the first mention of binary search as part of the Moore School Lectures, a seminal and foundational college course in computing. In 1957, William Wesley Peterson published the first method for interpolation search.[57] Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two[i] until 1960, when Derrick Henry Lehmer published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays.[59] In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an ALGOL 60 implementation of binary search that placed the comparison for equality at the end, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The uniform binary search was developed by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University in 1971. In 1986, Bernard Chazelle and Leonidas J. Guibas introduced fractional cascading as a method to solve numerous search problems in computational geometry.[46][60][61]

Implementation issues [ edit ]

Although the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky Donald Knuth

When Jon Bentley assigned binary search as a problem in a course for professional programmers, he found that ninety percent failed to provide a correct solution after several hours of working on it, mainly because the incorrect implementations failed to run or returned a wrong answer in rare edge cases. A study published in 1988 shows that accurate code for it is only found in five out of twenty textbooks.[63] Furthermore, Bentley's own implementation of binary search, published in his 1986 book Programming Pearls, contained an overflow error that remained undetected for over twenty years. The Java programming language library implementation of binary search had the same overflow bug for more than nine years.[64]

In a practical implementation, the variables used to represent the indices will often be of fixed size (integers), and this can result in an arithmetic overflow for very large arrays. If the midpoint of the span is calculated as L + R 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {L+R}{2}}} , then the value of L + R L+R may exceed the range of integers of the data type used to store the midpoint, even if L L and R R are within the range. If L L and R R are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint as L + R − L 2 {\displaystyle L+{\frac {R-L}{2}}} .[65]

An infinite loop may occur if the exit conditions for the loop are not defined correctly. Once L L exceeds R R , the search has failed and must convey the failure of the search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, or in the case of an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that most of the programmers who incorrectly implemented binary search made an error in defining the exit conditions.

In Big O notation, the base of the logarithm does not matter since every logarithm of a given base is a constant factor of another logarithm of another base. That is,, whereis a constant. ^ internal path is any path from the root to an existing node. Let I I internal path length, the sum of the lengths of all internal paths. If each element is equally likely to be searched, the average case is 1 + I n {\displaystyle 1+{\frac {I}{n}}} after the root node. Adding the average of these lengths to the one iteration at the root yields the average case. Therefore, to minimize the average number of comparisons, the internal path length I I external path length (the path length over all nodes where both children are present for each already-existing node) is minimized when the external nodes (the nodes with no children) lie within two consecutive levels of the tree. This also applies to internal paths as internal path length I I E E n n I = E − 2 n {\displaystyle I=E-2n} Any search algorithm based solely on comparisons can be represented using a binary comparison tree. Anis any path from the root to an existing node. Letbe the, the sum of the lengths of all internal paths. If each element is equally likely to be searched, the average case isor simply one plus the average of all the internal path lengths of the tree. This is because internal paths represent the elements that the search algorithm compares to the target. The lengths of these internal paths represent the number of iterationsthe root node. Adding the average of these lengths to the one iteration at the root yields the average case. Therefore, to minimize the average number of comparisons, the internal path lengthmust be minimized. It turns out that the tree for binary search minimizes the internal path length. Knuth 1998 proved that thelength (the path length over all nodes where both children are present for each already-existing node) is minimized when the external nodes (the nodes with no children) lie within two consecutive levels of the tree. This also applies to internal paths as internal path lengthis linearly related to external path length. For any tree ofnodes,. When each subtree has a similar number of nodes, or equivalently the array is divided into halves in each iteration, the external nodes as well as their interior parent nodes lie within two levels. It follows that binary search minimizes the number of average comparisons as its comparison tree has the lowest possible internal path length. ^ 17.5 log 2 ⁡ n + 17 {\textstyle 17.5\log _{2}n+17} 18 log 2 ⁡ n − 16 {\textstyle 18\log _{2}n-16} Knuth 1998 showed on his MIX computer model, which Knuth designed as a representation of an ordinary computer, that the average running time of this variation for a successful search isunits of time compared tounits for regular binary search.

Answer: The most efficient searching algorithm you can use while programming in C++ is Binary Search, provided that the data structure is sorted and allows constant time access to its elements. Binary Search reduces the time complexity to O(log N), making it faster than linear search, especially for large arrays. It can be implemented using either an iterative or recursive approach.

The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N).\\n\\nConditions for when to apply Binary Search in a Data Structure:\\n\\nTo apply Binary Search algorithm:\\n\\nThe data structure must be sorted.\\n\\nAccess to any element of the data structure takes constant time.\\n\\nBinary Search Algorithm:\\n\\nIn this algorithm, Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index “mid” . Compare the middle element of the search space with the key.\\n\\nIf the key is found at middle element, the process is terminated.\\n\\nIf the key is not found at middle element, choose which half will be used as the next search space. If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used for next search. If the key is larger than the middle element, then the right side is used for next search.\\n\\nThis process is continued until the key is found or the total search space is exhausted.\\n\\nHow does Binary Search work?\\n\\nTo understand the working of binary search, consider the following illustration:\\n\\nConsider an array arr[] = {2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91}, and the target = 23. First Step: Calculate the mid and compare the mid element with the key. If the key is less than mid element, move to left and if it is greater than the mid then move search space to the right. Key (i.e., 23) is greater than current mid element (i.e., 16). The search space moves to the right. Key is less than the current mid 56. The search space moves to the left. Second Step: If the key matches the value of the mid element, the element is found and stop search.\\n\\nHow to Implement Binary Search?\\n\\nThe Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in the following two ways\\n\\nIterative Binary Search Algorithm\\n\\nRecursive Binary Search Algorithm\\n\\nGiven below are the pseudocodes for the approaches.\\n\\n1.

RAG Score: 101
GraphRAG Score: 101Question: How can a business consultant effectively measure and communicate the intangible benefits of their consultation, such as improved team dynamics or enhanced leadership skills, to their clients?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: One technique for quantifying intangible benefits is a scenario analysis, which examines the potential outcomes of a specific course of action. Business leaders determine the likelihood of achieving each intangible benefit, then assign an estimated value based on the total intangible benefit of a project based on these odds. For example, a business may determine that investing in employee training has only a 10-percent chance of improving customer satisfaction to a given level. This option would therefore be quantifiably less appealing than investing the same amount of money in a new product return policy that has a 50-percent chance of improving customer satisfaction to the same target level.
What Are Tangible Benefits?

Tangible benefits are positive results that can be accurately measured and quantified with standard measurements. In business, the term describes any kind of outcome that is directly associated with financial gain or loss. You can always boil down tangible benefits to a monetary value relative to other types of investments or processes in the organization.

The Value of Tangible Benefits

There are several reasons why businesses need to recognize tangible benefits and know how to use them. Without measurement, there can be no consistent improvement. The ability to quantify different outcomes is essential for actually comparing them with each other to determine the best option. This means that tangible benefits are crucial for the “Measure” phase of the Six Sigma DMAIC protocol.

Tangible benefits are also much more predictable than intangible ones, which means companies can use this information to develop strategy and crisis control plans. The processes of measurement, prediction and control are all linked together, which is why many business leaders put more emphasis on these benefits.

How to Calculate Tangible Benefits

The process and difficulty for calculating tangible benefits depends on the specifics of the situation. It’s easy to quantify the impact of losing a sale because you know exactly how much value of the sale. However, isolating value-added benefits in a more complex process often require technical knowledge, industry experience and thorough data analysis.

What Are Intangible Benefits?

Intangible benefits are all the positive results of a process or action that can’t be easily or accurately measured. They are sometimes called “soft” benefits to distinguish them from the “hard” tangible ones. The nebulous nature of this concept can be discouraging to some leaders, but it doesn’t have to stay this way. Understanding and embracing these benefits is as important step in professional development.

The Value of Intangible Benefits

Just because they aren’t as easy to measure, predict or understand doesn’t mean they aren’t as important. Soft benefits can make or break a company just as easily as hard ones. They can have a widespread or long-term impact that can shift the overall trajectory of an organization. They can also have significant financial implications even if these results can’t be immediately connected to the cause.

How to Calculate Intangible Benefits

Since businesses can’t measure intangible benefits in terms of financial gain, they need to develop “soft” metrics. This could include things like assessing employee morale, random public surveys or interviews with customers about their experiences with the process in question. Anecdotal and subjective data is one of the only ways to keep your finger on the pulse so you can try to maintain positive momentum.

Tangible vs Intangible Benefits: What’s the Difference?

Tangible and intangible benefits are opposite sides of the same coin. Any benefit in business is either tangible or intangible. It has to be one or the other and it can’t be both. The difference between them is entirely based on the ability to measure, quantify and compare the results.

The ability to accurately quantify the outcome leads to several other major differences, including predictability and consistency. Tangible benefits tend to be more predictable and stable. They usually rise and fall over time due to predictable factors. Intangible benefits are a lot more wild. They are hard to predict and they can fluctuate wildly.

Tangible vs Intangible Benefits: Who would use Tangible or Intangible Benefits?

Every business leader and every company should care about both kinds of benefits. Every action taken by a business should be done to obtain certain benefits and every business needs both kinds of benefits to succeed. Tangible benefits are often a high priority in lean business programs because they are data-driven. However, there is room for investment in soft benefits even in lean manufacturing or management environments.

Tangible and Intangible Benefits: Real World Scenarios

A small sports supplier generates revenue by selling products at their physical location as well as online to a national market. As the brand gains recognition, the leaders decide to take action to boost their growth.

The company decided to expand their physical store hours by 2 hours each day. Sales numbers from this period show a steady increase in revenue since the change. In this case, the additional revenue from previous periods is the tangible benefit. However, this benefit should be greater than the cost of the extra store hours.

The same company also decides to expand their online marketing efforts. One of their strategies is to develop video content for posting on social media. Successful marketing could make a video go viral and increase brand visibility massively, or it could fall flat and make no impact at all. Even though it’s impossible to accurately link a financial value to the videos being posted, it can be a big part of building brand authority and recognition in the outdoors niche.

Learn to Appreciate Value

Leaders who learn how to balance and appreciate both tangible and intangible benefits have mastered one of the most difficult skills in the business world. Data science prizes tangible benefits, which is why they’ve become a modern management fixation. However, undue focus on tangible results can cripple a company. Just because you can’t put a price tag on something doesn’t mean it isn’t worth the effort.
Answer: A business consultant can effectively measure and communicate the intangible benefits of their consultation by developing "soft" metrics to assess these benefits. This could include conducting surveys or interviews with employees and leaders to gather anecdotal and subjective data on team dynamics and leadership skills. The consultant can also use random public surveys to gauge external perceptions or changes in customer experiences related to the consultation. By collecting and analyzing this qualitative data, the consultant can provide a narrative or case study that highlights the positive impacts of their work, even if these results cannot be directly quantified in financial terms. This approach helps keep a finger on the pulse of the organization's culture and leadership, allowing the consultant to demonstrate the value of intangible benefits to their clients.

They are hard to predict and they can fluctuate wildly.\\n\\nTangible vs Intangible Benefits: Who would use Tangible or Intangible Benefits?\\n\\nEvery business leader and every company should care about both kinds of benefits. Every action taken by a business should be done to obtain certain benefits and every business needs both kinds of benefits to succeed. Tangible benefits are often a high priority in lean business programs because they are data-driven. However, there is room for investment in soft benefits even in lean manufacturing or management environments.\\n\\nTangible and Intangible Benefits: Real World Scenarios\\n\\nA small sports supplier generates revenue by selling products at their physical location as well as online to a national market. As the brand gains recognition, the leaders decide to take action to boost their growth.\\n\\nThe company decided to expand their physical store hours by 2 hours each day. Sales numbers from this period show a steady increase in revenue since the change. In this case, the additional revenue from previous periods is the tangible benefit. However, this benefit should be greater than the cost of the extra store hours.\\n\\nThe same company also decides to expand their online marketing efforts. One of their strategies is to develop video content for posting on social media. Successful marketing could make a video go viral and increase brand visibility massively, or it could fall flat and make no impact at all. Even though it’s impossible to accurately link a financial value to the videos being posted, it can be a big part of building brand authority and recognition in the outdoors niche.\\n\\nLearn to Appreciate Value\\n\\nLeaders who learn how to balance and appreciate both tangible and intangible benefits have mastered one of the most difficult skills in the business world. Data science prizes tangible benefits, which is why they’ve become a modern management fixation. However, undue focus on tangible results can cripple a company. Just because you can’t put a price tag on something doesn’t mean it isn’t worth the effort.', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.8319628238677979, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:4826'})]
Answer: A business consultant can effectively measure and communicate the intangible benefits of their consultation by developing "soft" metrics to assess these outcomes. This could include conducting surveys or interviews with employees to gather anecdotal and subjective data on team dynamics and leadership skills. Additionally, the consultant can use scenario analysis to estimate the potential outcomes and assign a value to these intangible benefits based on their likelihood and impact. By presenting this data alongside tangible benefits, the consultant can provide a comprehensive view of the consultation's value to the client.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: When Saxon strangers first came to Ireland: the raid on Brega, AD 684

Published in Features

In AD 684 an episode unique in Irish history occurred: a major military expedition by Anglo-Saxon forces. As with all historical events of this period, the details are sparse. The raid was on the Irish kingdom of Brega (roughly present-day County Meath) and was a naval attack probably launched via the Isle of Man, then in Saxon hands. Contemporary Irish annals give few details, although the Annals of the Four Masters, compiled almost a thousand years later, state that there was a general devastation of the region and its churches, and that goods and hostages were carried off by the Saxons in their ships.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry for that year laments that churches were attacked and burned, and names the Saxon commander in the field as the ealdorman Berht. Bede in his Ecclesiastical history of the English people calls it an unwarranted attack on an innocent and Christian people, and criticises Ecgfrith, king of Northumbria, who planned and authorised the raid. Bede relates how clerics, including Ecgbert, a Saxon bishop working in Ireland, warned against such a course of action and that God would punish the Saxon king for such a deed. Another contemporary reference is given by the Irish annals, which show that in 686 Adomnán, the abbot of Iona, travelled to Northumbria to negotiate the release of 60 hostages seized from Brega and returned to Ireland with them. Nowhere in these sources is a motive or reason given for the attack, but perhaps we can gain clues from an analysis of the history of the period leading up to the event.In the seventh century the islands of Ireland and Britain were both composed of a shifting mosaic of kingdoms, where a powerful individual king or dynasty could emerge to claim dominance over his fellow kings. In Ireland the Uí Néills had emerged as the dominant dynasty, while in Anglo-Saxon England the most powerful kingdom was Northumbria, although in the latter half of the seventh century it was in decline, threatened from the south by the growing strength of the Saxon kingdom of Mercia.

Aldfrith and the Northumbrian succession

To their north, the Northumbrians claimed lordship over the kingdoms of the Irish in Dál Riata, the British of Strathclyde and the Picts, who were often in open revolt. When Ecgfrith launched his attack on Ireland he had been king for fifteen years, but he had other problems besides external pressures on his kingdom: in a violent world, where kings often met their death on the battlefield, he had no heir. Two of his brothers had been killed in battles with Mercia, and he had no sons of his own. He had married Aethelthryth, the daughter of the king of East Anglia, but she had declared at their marriage that she was devoting herself to God and intended to lead a chaste and celibate life. Bede praises this decision; while Ecgfrith’s immediate reaction is not recorded, he spent the followingdecade bribing his bishops with grants of land to persuade her to change her mind. She refused to do so and after twelve years Ecgfrith eventually remarried. The only effective heir to Northumbria in the 680s was Ecgfrith’s elder half-brother Aldfrith, an Irish-speaking scholar and poet who lived in a monastery on Iona.

Aldfrith’s father was Oswiu, a Saxon prince who lived in exile in Dál Riata with a number of his brothers and followers during the 620s and 630s; one of his brothers, Oisric, is recorded in the Annals of Tigernach as falling in battle in Ireland in 632 while fighting alongside the king of Dál Riata. While in exile, Bede tells us, these pagan Saxon princes received Christianity from their Irish hosts. Oswiu, who would later become king of Northumbria, fathered a child with an Irish princess, Fín, the daughter of Colmán Rímid of the northern Uí Néill, who is listed as a high king of Ireland. Their son Aldfrith, with Irish and Saxon royal blood in his veins, is remembered in the Irish sources as a poet and was not a warrior like his forefathers; he is never recorded as having fought in battle.In Ireland, where he was known as Flann Fína, he was recognised for his writing and learning, and Adomnán, the abbot of Iona and heir to the tradition of St Columba, regarded him as a friend of great learning and a man held in high esteem by the Irish church. His image in Saxon England was somewhat different. Bede felt that he was illegitimate at best and cast doubt on his being a son of Oswiu, while a sister of Ecgfrith confided in the Saxon bishop Cuthbert that she doubted the very existence of the shadowy figure of her Irish half-brother.Despite lacking an heir, in 684 Ecgfrith was planning a campaign against the rebellious Picts, but he first launched an attack against the southern Uí Néill kingdom of Brega, which was ruled at the time by the high king Fínsnechta Fledach. What was the motivation for such a venture, since Bede claimed that the Irish were no threat to Ecgfrith? Was Aldfrith preparing to move against Ecgfrith with the support of his Uí Néill relatives and did Ecgfrith wish to seize hostages to prevent this (to ‘get his retaliation in first’)? Everything we know about the character of Aldfrith casts doubt on this, but Ecgfrith did know the value of holding hostages; as a child, he had himself been held hostage by the Mercian king Penda, and was only released when his father killed Penda in battle. If Ecgfrith now wanted Irish hostages, surely it was to prevent Irish kings from supporting the Picts, whether that support came from Ireland itself or from the Irish kingdom of Dál Riata.

How did Aldfrith become king of Northumbria?

In the spring of 685 Ecgfrith made his move against the Picts and personally led an army deep into their territory. It ended in disaster. On 20 May, at the battle of Nechtansmere, the Saxon army was obliterated and Ecgfrith and the cream of the Anglo-Saxon nobility perished on the battlefield. Bede claims that Ecgfrith’s fate was divine retribution for his unwarranted attack on the Irish and their churches, and that he had ignored clerical warnings from both Ireland and England not to attack the Picts. The sequence of events that followed the battle is unclear but somehow Aldfrith became king of Northumbria, and in 686 his friend Adomnán visited him and arranged for the hostages from Brega to be freed. Some months appear to have elapsed between Ecgfrith’s death and the accession of the new king, so how did the Irish-speaking scholar with no known military experience come to assume the crown when he was not held in high regard in Northumbria?Some twelfth-century English chroniclers wrote of a tradition that after Nechtansmere Ecgfrith was buried on the island of Iona, a place of burial for saints and kings. Irish, Pictish and Scottish kings were interred there over the centuries, and in our own time John Smith, the Scottish leader of the British Labour Party, was laid to rest there in 1994. But there is no obvious or logical reason why a Saxon king who had devastated churches in Ireland before attacking the Picts should be buried in such holy ground, and the idea has been largely dismissed. Perhaps it is not so fanciful, however.Towards the end of the eighth century the monks of the monastery of Tallaght compiled a martyrology of the saints of Ireland, drawing their names from various sources, one of which was apparently a list of the holy men buried on Iona. As well as the expected names of Columba, Adomnán and other abbots, the name of the aforementioned Saxon bishop Ecgbert appears, and his death while living at Iona is independently recorded. There is, however, an intriguing entry for 27 May: Echbritan mac Óssu [Ecgfrith son of Oswiu], someone whom the monks at Tallaght, over a century after his death, must have presumed to have been a saint because of the location of his grave. What is more startling is that when Micheál Ó Cléirigh compiled a list of the saints of Ireland in the 1620s and used the Martyrology of Tallaght as a source for his Donegal Martyrology, he directly transcribed Ecgfrith’s feast-day as 27 May, yet we know that Ó Cléirigh, the driving force behind the Four Masters, was familiar with Bede and might have been expected to know exactly who Ecgfrith was.

Who might have buried Ecgfrith on Iona?

If we accept that Ecgfrith was buried on Iona, how did his remains get there, who transported his body and why? His followers who survived the battle could have done so, knowing that his heir, Aldfrith, was living there, but this is unlikely. Bede relates that Ecgfrith’s forces at Nechtansmere were annihilated, with many survivors being taken into slavery and only a few making their way south to safety. They would not first have headed west through difficult and hostile territory to the remote island of Iona. Would the Picts have been responsible for carrying the corpse of their bitter enemy to a site where Pictish kings were buried in order to grant their hated overlord a Christian and respectful burial? Again, this is unlikely.This leaves the possibility that it was Irish soldiers who had fought at Nechtansmere who transported the body of a dead Saxon king across the mountainous spine of Scotland and presented it to their kinsman, Aldfrith. He then gave his half-brother an honourable funeral before travelling south to Northumbria to claim his inheritance. There is no record of who travelled with him or whether a Saxon delegation came to meet him, only that it was some months before he became the new king of Northumbria. The only definite fact is that Adomnán, the leading Irish churchman of the time, was in the Northumbrian capital the following year, arranging for the Irish hostages to be freed. The contemporary Irish sources, including Adomnán’s Life of Columba, say little about these events, in an almost aloof manner, while English sources are equally silent, almost as if the whole affair was something of an embarrassment. Even Bede is unusually reluctant to flesh out the details, which he must have known as he lived through these events. He is content to comment that Northumbria’s borders and sphere of influence were now reduced and that Aldfrith’s reign would prove to be a peaceful one.The apparent conclusion is that Ecgfrith had been correct in his intention of attacking Ireland to prevent Irish support for the Picts but that the manner of the attack backfired on him in a spectacular way. In moving against the southern Uí Néill in Brega and seizing hostages from them, he picked the wrong target; prospective Irish support for Aldfrith would have come from his close kinsmen, the northern Uí Néill. Dál Riata, anxious to throw off the yoke of Northumbrian overlordship, would have had every motivation to assist in such a venture.It is an intriguing thought that the blood of an Irish high king might have flowed, via Aldfrith, through the veins of the English royal line, but this was not to be. Two of Aldfrith’s sons succeeded him, but his line became extinct. In fact, the lineage of Irish kingship in the British monarchy came from the Stuarts, with James VI of Scotland, later James I of England, acknowledging Fergus Mór mac Eric, a king of Dál Riata at the beginning of the sixth century, as his direct ancestor. It was as a direct result of Nechtansmere that Anglo-Saxon acquisition of Scottish lands failed and that a kingdom of Scotland could later emerge from the integration of Dál Riata and the Pictish people.

Invaders In 410 the Roman emperor, Honorius, told the local authorities in Britain that he could not send any reinforcements to help them defend the province against 'barbarian' attacks. The Roman armies on the continent were overstretched, fighting both the tribes who had come over the Rhine and Danube frontiers and also the Roman generals (including some from Britain) who wanted to control the empire themselves. The term 'Anglo-Saxon' did not become common until the eighth century, when people on the continent started using it. Roman Britain was being attacked from three directions. The Irish (called 'Scotti' by the Romans) attacked from the west; the Picts from the north; and various Germanic-speaking peoples from the east, across the North Sea. The latter included the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, who were all from northern Germany or southern Denmark. The continental invaders were generally called 'Saxons' by their neighbours. England is still called 'Sasana' in Gaelic, and its inhabitants are 'Sassenachs'. The term 'Anglo-Saxon' did not become common until the eighth century, when people on the continent started using it to distinguish between the inhabitants of Britain and the Saxons who remained in northern Germany. The Anglo-Saxons themselves had by then begun to use the word 'Angli' or 'English' to refer to themselves. The Romano-Britons defended themselves against the invaders as best they could, with successful military leaders including Ambrosius Aurelianus and the possibly entirely legendary figure of Arthur. New kings emerged to rule different kingdoms within the former Roman province. One hundred and fifty years after the end of Roman rule, some were still taking Roman names like Constantine and Aurelius. Top

Settlers and missionaries By 500 AD, many of the invaders had settled. There were Irish settlements in western Britain, including a powerful Irish kingdom called Dal Riata (or Dalriada), in modern Argyll and Bute in Scotland. The Angles, Saxons and Jutes had taken over most of the area east of a line from the Humber to the Isle of Wight. The process by which the invaders settled down is very obscure. The only written source of any length from the period is a vague and generalised account from a British monk, Gildas, who saw the coming of the Anglo-Saxons as God's punishment for the sins of the Britons. The Christian church had been well-established and it suffered greatly from the invasions. Archaeology has revealed a good deal about the Anglo-Saxons, particularly through their cemeteries, where weapons and other personal possessions were placed in graves. The most famous of these graves is Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk, probably the royal cemetery of the kings of East Anglia. A 30-foot oak ship was buried here, and some of the many objects buried with it suggest that Swedes may have been involved in the settlement of that area. The Christian church had been well-established in Roman Britain by the early fifth century, and it suffered greatly from the invasions. But it did survive in those parts of Roman Britain that escaped the Anglo-Saxon invasions. From that church came two missionaries who started to bring Christianity beyond the former imperial frontiers in Britain. St Nynia (or Ninian) was the first missionary in Scotland. Almost the only thing we know about him was that he founded a church at Whithorn (Dumfries and Galloway). St Patrick was the first known missionary in Ireland. He had been captured as a boy by Irish raiders, but managed to escape from his slavery. At some point he decided to go back to Ireland. We do not know his dates or anything about where he worked, but he seems to have been buried at Downpatrick (County Down) in the late fifth century, although later on it was the church in Armagh that claimed him as its own. Numerous churches and monasteries were founded in the generations after St Patrick's death. Probably the most important founder was St Columba, who founded Derry and Durrow in Ireland and, after deciding to leave Ireland in 565 AD, founded the monastery of Iona on an island west of the Isle of Mull in Scotland. Top

The Venerable Bede The Venerable Bede (died 735 AD), whose 'Ecclesiastical History of the English People' is our major source for the history of Britain from the late sixth to the early eighth century, blames the Britons for not trying to convert the Anglo-Saxons. For Bede the important thing about the faith of the Britons was that it came straight from Rome, and was therefore pure and orthodox. Bede tells how Gregory the Great (pope from 590 to 604 AD) decided to send a missionary called Augustine to England to found major churches in London and York. When Augustine arrived in the south east of England in 597 AD, he found that Æthelberht, king of Kent, was the most powerful king in the south east. Thanks to Bede's work, the new Anglo-Saxon kingdoms come into the light of history. Æthelberht gave him land in Canterbury to build a church, and thus by accident Canterbury, rather than London, became the main centre for English Christianity. Æthelberht and his court converted, and several neighbouring kings as well. The last surviving member of Gregory's mission was Paulinus, who baptised Edwin, king of Northumbria, in York in 627 AD. Thanks to Bede's work, the new Anglo-Saxon kingdoms come into the light of history at the beginning of the seventh century. In the south there were the kingdoms of Kent, of the South Saxons (Sussex), and the West Saxons (Wessex); to the east were the kingdoms of the East Angles (East Anglia) and the East Saxons (Essex); in the Midlands was the kingdom of the Mercians, which (like some others) was an amalgamation of several smaller kingdoms; and north of the Humber were Deira (Yorkshire) and Bernicia (north of the Tees). These last two kingdoms were joined together as Northumbria in the early seventh century. Northumbria swallowed up a number of other kingdoms in the early seventh century, such as Elmet (West Yorkshire) and Rheged (Lancashire and Cumbria). Wessex and Mercia (whose name means 'the frontier kingdom') also benefited from their ability to expand westwards. Some British kingdoms remained independent, including Cornwall and Devon in the south west, Gwynedd and Powys in modern Wales, and Strathclyde, in what is now the region of Glasgow. In northern Ireland there were numerous small kingdoms, although the most powerful dynasty was that of the Uí Néill, the supposed descendents of the great king, Niall of the Nine Hostages. Top

A divided church When Edwin, king of Northumbria, was killed by an alliance between a Christian king, Cadwalla of Gwynedd, and a pagan king, Penda of Mercia, in 632 AD, the newly established church in Northumbria was in danger. And when Oswald, king of Northumbria, had reclaimed his throne he turned not to Rome, but to the Irish monastery of Iona, where he had spent time in exile. King Oswiu called the synod of Whitby to settle the issue of when Easter should be celebrated. Iona sent Aidan to Northumbria as its bishop, and he founded his see at Lindisfarne (Northumberland), not the traditional metropolitan centre of York. For the Anglo-Saxon monk Bede, the Irishman Aidan was the great hero of the early English church. Lindisfarne became a training centre for the Irish and English missionaries who went further south to convert Mercians, East Angles, East Saxons and South Saxons. The Roman church's mission in England had, to a large extent, failed, but the Irish missionaries succeeded spectacularly. At the same time, Irish monks from Iona were founding churches along the western coast of Scotland and the Isles. Those in northern Britain who had been converted by the Irish monks tended to remain loyal to Iona and its traditions. By the middle of the seventh century, however, these traditions came to be seen as divisive. In particular, the rest of the church in England and Ireland had adopted new Roman methods of calculating the date of Easter. In the early 660s AD, the Northumbrian court had the unedifying spectacle of King Oswiu and his followers celebrating Easter in the Ionan way, and his Kentish wife Eanflæd and son Alhfrith holding their ceremonies in a different week. Oswiu called the synod of Whitby to settle the issue, and himself decided for St Peter (Rome) over St Columba (Iona). Irish influence on the English church waned from that point, and still more after the forging of new links with Rome. In 668 AD, Pope Vitalian appointed Theodore, who came from Tarsus in Asia Minor, as archbishop of Canterbury. Theodore did much to unite the church in England, to introduce new learning (especially in Greek), and to create new dioceses. He also assisted in the deposition of those who opposed his schemes, such as St Wilfred of York. Top

Northumbria dominant The monasteries founded by the Irishman Columbanus in both France and Italy inspired many imitations and other Irishmen followed him to the continent. Most of these Irishmen went abroad in self-exile, as a religious penance. It was different for the English, who (according to Bede) were inspired by Egbert to go abroad to save their Germanic cousins from paganism. Northumbria was at a cultural crossroads between Ireland, England and Rome. Egbert was a Northumbrian who had lived for many years in Ireland. At his instigation, Wihtbert and Willibrord went to convert the Frisians (in the Netherlands and North Germany), and two men, both called Hewald, went to convert the Saxons. The greatest English missionary was Boniface, a West Saxon, who reorganised the church in central Germany and Bavaria, and who led the reform of the Frankish church. In 751 AD, he presided at the coronation and anointing of the first king of a new dynasty of Frankish kings, later called the Carolingians. He died in 754 AD, murdered by a band of Frisians. Northumbria was not as powerful in the early eighth century as it had been earlier. The devastating defeat of King Ecgfrith's army at the hands of the Picts at Nechtansmere (Dunnichen, in Angus) in 685 AD put an end to northern expansion, and the rising power of Mercia in the south curbed ambitions in that direction. Nevertheless, Northumbria's position at a cultural crossroads between Ireland, England and Rome brought about great achievements. In the seventh century Benedict Biscop, the founder of Bede's monastery of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth (Tyne and Wear), had travelled to the continent to collect books on five occasions. The library he created was one of the best north of the Alps, and it was partly thanks to this collection of books that Bede became the greatest scholar in Europe in the early eighth century. Northumbria produced outstanding works of sculpture, like the Ruthwell Cross (Dumfries and Galloway) and one of the most beautiful books of all time, the 'Lindisfarne Gospels' (now in the British Library). Northumbria also produced the first known English poet at this time, Cædmon, who lived on the estates of the monastery of Whitby (North Yorkshire). The last product of the Northumbrian Renaissance was Alcuin of York, a scholar and Latin poet, who was recruited in 782 AD by Charlemagne, king of the Franks, to lead the educational revival on the continent. Top

Mercia dominant After the battle of Nechtansmere, Mercia was in an undisputed position as the most powerful English kingdom. Æthelbald, king of Mercia from 716 to 757 AD, called himself 'king of Britain'. His murder by his own bodyguard suggests serious internal problems, and it was his equally long-lived successor Offa (king from 757 to 796 AD) who witnessed the greatest expansion of Mercian power. Offa dominated other English kingdoms more successfully than previous English kings. He is best known for the building of Offa's Dyke, a 90-mile long earthwork marking the boundary between Mercia and Wales. This may have been a response to the growing power of the kings of Gwynedd, who were also styling themselves 'kings of the Britons' at just the time that Offa began calling himself 'king of the English'. Offa certainly dominated the other English kingdoms more successfully than previous English kings, and he was even able to portray himself as a major figure on the European stage. The eighth century was a time of considerable prosperity in England, as excavations have shown in the first towns that emerged after the collapse of Roman urban life - Southampton, London, Ipswich and York. It was a prosperity that was severely challenged by the arrival of the Vikings. Top

Answer: The context provided does not offer direct evidence of Anglo-Saxons moving to Ireland and integrating into medieval Irish society. However, it does highlight significant cultural exchanges and interactions between the Irish and Anglo-Saxons during the early Middle Ages. For instance, it mentions that Saxon princes, including Oswiu, lived in exile in Dál Riata, where they received Christianity from their Irish hosts. This suggests some level of integration and cultural exchange.

Additionally, the context notes that Aldfrith, an Irish-speaking scholar and poet with both Irish and Saxon royal blood, was recognized in Ireland for his writing and learning. This indicates that individuals of mixed heritage were present and could be integrated into Irish society, at least in intellectual and religious circles.

While these examples show interactions and some level of integration, the context does not provide specific evidence of a broader movement of Anglo-Saxons into Ireland or their integration into medieval Irish society as a whole. The focus is more on individual cases and the cultural and religious exchanges that occurred between the two groups.

Context: [RetrieverResultItem(content="{'id': ':0', 'index': 0, 'text': 'When Saxon strangers first came to Ireland: the raid on Brega, AD 684\\n\\nPublished in Features\\n\\nIn AD 684 an episode unique in Irish history occurred: a major military expedition by Anglo-Saxon forces. As with all historical events of this period, the details are sparse. The raid was on the Irish kingdom of Brega (roughly present-day County Meath) and was a naval attack probably launched via the Isle of Man, then in Saxon hands. Contemporary Irish annals give few details, although the Annals of the Four Masters, compiled almost a thousand years later, state that there was a general devastation of the region and its churches, and that goods and hostages were carried off by the Saxons in their ships.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry for that year laments that churches were attacked and burned, and names the Saxon commander in the field as the ealdorman Berht. Bede in his Ecclesiastical history of the English people calls it an unwarranted attack on an innocent and Christian people, and criticises Ecgfrith, king of Northumbria, who planned and authorised the raid. Bede relates how clerics, including Ecgbert, a Saxon bishop working in Ireland, warned against such a course of action and that God would punish the Saxon king for such a deed. Another contemporary reference is given by the Irish annals, which show that in 686 Adomnán, the abbot of Iona, travelled to Northumbria to negotiate the release of 60 hostages seized from Brega and returned to Ireland with them. Nowhere in these sources is a motive or reason given for the attack, but perhaps we can gain clues from an analysis of the history of the period leading up to the event.In the seventh century the islands of Ireland and Britain were both composed of a shifting mosaic of kingdoms, where a powerful individual king or dynasty could emerge to claim dominance over his fellow kings. In Ireland the Uí Néills had emerged as the dominant dynasty, while in Anglo-Saxon England the most powerful kingdom was Northumbria, although in the latter half of the seventh century it was in decline, threatened from the south by the growing strength of the Saxon kingdom of Mercia.\\n\\nAldfrith and the Northumbrian succession\\n\\nTo their north, the Northumbrians claimed lordship over the kingdoms of the Irish in Dál Riata, the British of Strathclyde and the Picts, who were often in open revolt. When Ecgfrith launched his attack on Ireland he had been king for fifteen years, but he had other problems besides external pressures on his kingdom: in a violent world, where kings often met their death on the battlefield, he had no heir. Two of his brothers had been killed in battles with Mercia, and he had no sons of his own. He had married Aethelthryth, the daughter of the king of East Anglia, but she had declared at their marriage that she was devoting herself to God and intended to lead a chaste and celibate life. Bede praises this decision; while Ecgfrith’s immediate reaction is not recorded, he spent the followingdecade bribing his bishops with grants of land to persuade her to change her mind. She refused to do so and after twelve years Ecgfrith eventually remarried. The only effective heir to Northumbria in the 680s was Ecgfrith’s elder half-brother Aldfrith, an Irish-speaking scholar and poet who lived in a monastery on Iona.\\n\\nAldfrith’s father was Oswiu, a Saxon prince who lived in exile in Dál Riata with a number of his brothers and followers during the 620s and 630s; one of his brothers, Oisric, is recorded in the Annals of Tigernach as falling in battle in Ireland in 632 while fighting alongside the king of Dál Riata. While in exile, Bede tells us, these pagan Saxon princes received Christianity from their Irish hosts. Oswiu, who would later become king of Northumbria, fathered a child with an Irish princess, Fín, the daughter of Colmán Rímid of the northern Uí Néill, who is listed as a high king of Ireland. Their son Aldfrith, with Irish and Saxon royal blood in his veins, is remembered in the Irish sources as a poet and was not a warrior like his forefathers; he is never recorded as having fought in battle.In Ireland, where he was known as Flann Fína, he was recognised for his writing and learning, and Adomnán, the abbot of Iona and heir to the tradition of St Columba, regarded him as a friend of great learning and a man held in high esteem by the Irish church. His image in Saxon England was somewhat different. Bede felt that he was illegitimate at best and cast doubt on his being a son of Oswiu, while a sister of Ecgfrith confided in the Saxon bishop Cuthbert that she doubted the very existence of the shadowy figure of her Irish half-brother.Despite lacking an heir, in 684 Ecgfrith was planning a campaign against the rebellious Picts, but he first launched an attack against the southern Uí Néill kingdom of Brega, which was ruled at the time by the high king Fínsnechta Fledach. What was the motivation for such a venture, since Bede claimed that the Irish were no threat to Ecgfrith? Was Aldfrith preparing to move against Ecgfrith with the support of his Uí Néill relatives and did Ecgfrith wish to seize hostages to prevent this (to ‘get his retaliation in first’)? Everything we know about the character of Aldfrith casts doubt on this, but Ecgfrith did know the value of holding hostages; as a child, he had himself been held hostage by the Mercian king Penda, and was only released when his father killed Penda in battle. If Ecgfrith now wanted Irish hostages, surely it was to prevent Irish kings from supporting the Picts, whether that support came from Ireland itself or from the Irish kingdom of Dál Riata.\\n\\nHow did Aldfrith become king of Northumbria?\\n\\nIn the spring of 685 Ecgfrith made his move against the Picts and personally led an army deep into their territory. It ended in disaster. On 20 May, at the battle of Nechtansmere, the Saxon army was obliterated and Ecgfrith and the cream of the Anglo-Saxon nobility perished on the battlefield. Bede claims that Ecgfrith’s fate was divine retribution for his unwarranted attack on the Irish and their churches, and that he had ignored clerical warnings from both Ireland and England not to attack the Picts. The sequence of events that followed the battle is unclear but somehow Aldfrith became king of Northumbria, and in 686 his friend Adomnán visited him and arranged for the hostages from Brega to be freed.

Answer: Mob justice, in response to a perceived injustice, occurs when a crowd of people collectively acts as accusers, jury, and judge to punish a suspected wrongdoer immediately on the spot. This action is often driven by a lack of faith in local law enforcement and judicial systems, leading the community to take justice into their own hands. It is a backward-looking action fueled by a sense of insecurity and focuses on a particular target, determined by how the insecurity is defined. Public officials may directly or indirectly participate in or overlook these actions, which can lead to severe human rights abuses and a denial of due process for the accused. Mob justice is particularly prevalent in African states, where it manifests as an immediate and punitive response to perceived wrongdoings, such as theft, occurring outside the control of the formal justice system.

Answer: Mob justice, in response to a perceived injustice, occurs when a crowd of people collectively acts as accusers, jury, and judge, and punishes a suspected wrongdoer on the spot. This form of justice arises from a lack of faith in local law enforcement and judicial systems, leading the community to take matters into their own hands. It is often a reaction to a sense of insecurity and is directed at a particular target, chosen based on how the community defines the perceived threat. Mob justice is a dangerous practice that bypasses the formal justice system, resulting in severe human rights abuses and denying suspects due process and the right to a fair trial.

Answer: The stability of a mathematical model, meaning it does not blow up, is an important factor in trusting the results, but it is not the only consideration. Stability ensures that the model behaves well under small perturbations, but you also need to consider the accuracy and validity of the model. This involves checking if the model accurately represents the real-world system it is intended to simulate and if the assumptions and parameters used are appropriate. Calibration and validation against real data are crucial steps to ensure the model's results are trustworthy.

Benson, M. and O’Reilly, K. (2020) Reflexive Practice in Live Sociology: Lessons fromresearching Brexit in the lives of British Citizens living in the EU-27, Qualitative Research

This paper brings reflexivity into conversation with debates about positionality and live sociology to argue for reflexivity to be reimagined as an enduring practice that is collaborative, responsible, iterative, engaged, agile, and creative. We elaborate our argument with reference to examples and contemplations drawn from our experiences researching what Brexit means for Britons living in the EU27 for the BrExpats research project, which was informed from the outset by reflexive practice. We outline three (of a number of) potential strategies for engaging in reflexive practice: reflexive positioning, reflexive navigating, and reflexive interpreting or sense-making. We acknowledge that these are not separate actions in practice but are conceptually distinguishable aspects of an ongoing reflexive practice, informed by our

——————

Earlier post (2015!!!)

Reflexivity, in ethnography, has come to mean thinking carefully about who has done the research and how, under what conditions, how it was written, by whom, and what impact these might have on the value of the ethnography produced.

Prior to what has become known as ‘the reflexive turn’, ethnographers did their research without being self-critical, without thinking about their own role or their own impact, without reflecting on the various conditions under which the research was done (such as who was paying for it or who gave access to whom), and without taking much time to think about how to write up findings. It was if the ethnographer merely had to capture the, usually exotic, societies they studied, and then tell everyone else what they were like. It is still the same in much documentary film-making. We rarely get to see the photographer, the ways the sets were arranged, what happened before and after filming, how the film-maker decided what to put in and leave out, and so on. Yet few of us still believe ‘the camera never lies’.

The reflexive turn

‘The reflexive turn’ refers to a fairly dramatic change of perspective that occurred during the 1980s affecting many social sciences, especially social anthropology and its main method, ethnography. The ideas behind it came from philosophy and politics (including critical theory and feminism), and were also being debated and having their effect in other areas like textual criticism, cultural theory, and literary theory. To put it very simply (and crudely), the very nature of reality and how we can understand it as scientists came into question. Scholars were asking how we can know anything for sure when different scientists come up with different ideas. Many things we think we understand are not ever really seen, like atoms and gravity, so they rely on trust. Science is subject to fashions and fads. It relies heavily on the ability to predict the future based on the past, but that is nothing more than a mind game. Science appears to have failed in its promise to find answers to society’s problems.

The problem was seen to be even worse for social scientists because we are part of the world we study and thus can never truly be objective. The individuals we try to understand are not predictable; they have free will and can make choices, unlike natural phenomena. Everything we try to understand is filtered through personal experience and our own way of seeing the world. We always have to interpret what people mean when they tell us things, and we may get it entirely wrong. We are always in danger of being ethnocentric, of making sense of the world by relating it to what we already know and believe.

As a result of the reflexive turn, ethnographers began to look more critically at the ways in which ethnographic fieldwork had been (and was being) produced and written. They revealed that ethnographers had often been members of a colonial power studying those colonised, or were middle class people studying working class, or men trying to understand women. In many cases the relationship was an unequal one. But more than that, there was a tendency to portray the people being studied as somewhat exotic, backward or quaint. They studied the way ethnographies were written and noted how clever rhetorical devices were used to persuade the reader and that the ethnographies could indeed be seen as fiction rather than fact

Postmodern ethnographies

One response to the reflexive turn has been the postmodern ethnography. This refuses to give power to the ethnographer and instead accepts and celebrates the complex, ambiguous, messy nature of the social world and of ethnographic research. Postmodern ethnography self-consciously abandons the attempt to provide a neat, ordered narrative account written with a single authoritative voice. Instead they experiment with layered accounts, poetry, film, dance and other performances, or other approaches such as autobiography. Their goal is to challenge the view that there is a reality that exists external to the way we think about and experience it. Have a look at the work of Carol Rambo for example.

Reflexive ethnographies

I find the postmodern response exciting but somewhat defeatist. It is true that our relationship to our research has changed as a result of this intellectual movement and it is no longer possible to pretend we are not part of the world we study. However, this does not mean abandoning any sense that there is a real world we wish to learn about, and which our research participants live in, experience, feel constrained by, and help create. A less defeatist response has been to claim some authority for the academic ethnographer, while remembering that ethnographic studies are put together by human beings who make choices about what to research, interpret what they see and hear, decide what to write and how, and that they do all this in the context of their own personal biographies and often ensconced in scientific and disciplinary environments. Reflexive ethnographers think carefully about who has the power to say what about whom, and make sure that research participants (not subjects) have some influence or say over the research and how it is presented. They think carefully about what they write and read. They include some analysis of wider structures of power and control. They try to be honest about who has what influence over their work. They describe the context of the research and their place in that context, and perhaps provide some autobiographical details to help the reader understand their perspective better. They engage in conversations with research participants, rather than subjecting respondents to interviews. They learn from their own experiences, and build their analyses in interaction with the field, in an iterative-inductive way. Finally, they provide accounts that they realise are fragments, just part of a picture, fallible, and imperfect, (but still better than none). I discuss this more in my books on ethnography.
Answer: The context provided discusses the significant role of power and reflexivity in ethnography, particularly following the "reflexive turn" in the 1980s. This shift led ethnographers to critically examine the production and writing of ethnographic fieldwork, acknowledging the influence of power dynamics and the researcher's positionality. Here are some points from the context that support the claim that power and reflexivity are crucial in ethnography:

1. **Historical Context**: The reflexive turn highlighted how ethnographers often came from positions of power, such as being members of a colonial power studying colonized people, or being middle-class individuals studying the working class. This unequal relationship influenced the portrayal of the studied communities as exotic or backward.

2. **Critical Examination**: Ethnographers began to critically assess how ethnographic work was produced and written, recognizing the use of rhetorical devices to persuade readers and the potential for ethnographies to be seen as fiction rather than fact.

3. **Postmodern Ethnography**: In response to the reflexive turn, postmodern ethnography emerged, which challenges the authoritative voice of the ethnographer and embraces the complex, ambiguous nature of the social world. This approach highlights the importance of reflexivity in acknowledging the researcher's influence on the research process.

4. **Reflexive Ethnography**: Reflexive ethnographers focus on the power dynamics in research, ensuring that research participants have some influence over the research and its presentation. They consider their own positionality and the wider structures of power and control, providing context and autobiographical details to help readers understand their perspective.

5. **Iterative-Interactive Approach**: Reflexive ethnographers engage in conversations with research participants and build their analyses through interaction with the field, acknowledging that their accounts are fragments and imperfect but still valuable.

These points illustrate how power and reflexivity are integral to ethnography, as they shape the research process, the relationship between the researcher and participants, and the interpretation and presentation of findings.

We always have to interpret what people mean when they tell us things, and we may get it entirely wrong. We are always in danger of being ethnocentric, of making sense of the world by relating it to what we already know and believe.\\n\\nAs a result of the reflexive turn, ethnographers began to look more critically at the ways in which ethnographic fieldwork had been (and was being) produced and written. They revealed that ethnographers had often been members of a colonial power studying those colonised, or were middle class people studying working class, or men trying to understand women. In many cases the relationship was an unequal one. But more than that, there was a tendency to portray the people being studied as somewhat exotic, backward or quaint. They studied the way ethnographies were written and noted how clever rhetorical devices were used to persuade the reader and that the ethnographies could indeed be seen as fiction rather than fact\\n\\nPostmodern ethnographies\\n\\nOne response to the reflexive turn has been the postmodern ethnography. This refuses to give power to the ethnographer and instead accepts and celebrates the complex, ambiguous, messy nature of the social world and of ethnographic research. Postmodern ethnography self-consciously abandons the attempt to provide a neat, ordered narrative account written with a single authoritative voice. Instead they experiment with layered accounts, poetry, film, dance and other performances, or other approaches such as autobiography. Their goal is to challenge the view that there is a reality that exists external to the way we think about and experience it. Have a look at the work of Carol Rambo for example.\\n\\nReflexive ethnographies\\n\\nI find the postmodern response exciting but somewhat defeatist. It is true that our relationship to our research has changed as a result of this intellectual movement and it is no longer possible to pretend we are not part of the world we study. However, this does not mean abandoning any sense that there is a real world we wish to learn about, and which our research participants live in, experience, feel constrained by, and help create. A less defeatist response has been to claim some authority for the academic ethnographer, while remembering that ethnographic studies are put together by human beings who make choices about what to research, interpret what they see and hear, decide what to write and how, and that they do all this in the context of their own personal biographies and often ensconced in scientific and disciplinary environments. Reflexive ethnographers think carefully about who has the power to say what about whom, and make sure that research participants (not subjects) have some influence or say over the research and how it is presented. They think carefully about what they write and read. They include some analysis of wider structures of power and control. They try to be honest about who has what influence over their work. They describe the context of the research and their place in that context, and perhaps provide some autobiographical details to help the reader understand their perspective better. They engage in conversations with research participants, rather than subjecting respondents to interviews. They learn from their own experiences, and build their analyses in interaction with the field, in an iterative-inductive way. Finally, they provide accounts that they realise are fragments, just part of a picture, fallible, and imperfect, (but still better than none). I discuss this more in my books on ethnography.', 'embedding': None}", metadata={'score': 0.8662238121032715, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:5021'})]
Answer: Power and reflexivity are indeed significant components of ethnography, as highlighted by the context provided. The reflexive turn in ethnography, which emerged in the 1980s, brought attention to the influence of the researcher's positionality and the power dynamics inherent in the research process. Ethnographers began to critically examine how their own backgrounds, biases, and the conditions under which research was conducted affected the outcomes and interpretations of their studies. This shift acknowledged that researchers are part of the world they study and cannot be entirely objective.

Reflexive ethnographers focus on understanding who has the power to say what about whom and strive to ensure that research participants have some influence over the research and its presentation. They consider the wider structures of power and control and are transparent about their own influence on the research. By engaging in conversations with participants and providing context about their own positionality, reflexive ethnographers aim to produce more honest and nuanced accounts of the social world.

The context also mentions postmodern ethnographies, which challenge traditional authoritative narratives and embrace the complexity and ambiguity of social realities. These approaches further illustrate the importance of reflexivity and power dynamics in ethnographic research, as they seek to democratize the research process and acknowledge the multiple voices and perspectives involved.

The goal of daylighting is to collect enough daylight in the summer to turn off electric lights and collect as much as possible in the winter to help heat the building. Here are a few design elements that architects use to bring in as much natural daylight as possible:Building orientation. Light direction is important. Light that comes from the south is usually best for daylighting as sunlight is consistent throughout the day and year. This orientation can also be used for solar heat gain. Light that comes from the north is the next best, as the sunlight is as consistent as the south, just in a lower quantity. Light that comes from the east and west should be avoided if possible. Sunlight at these orientations is harsh, it only occurs during half the day,

  Natural light is a powerful architectural tool. As the importance of sustainable design grows, passive strategies like daylighting have become critical in reducing the impact of the built environment. Additionally, research in the last decade has shown daylighting to have significant health and wellness benefits for users.Today, we have more tools than ever to harness daylight. From innovative reflective materials to advanced computer modeling, architects are using modern technology to light buildings more efficiently. When you embrace these systems, you’ll create a brighter future.What is Passive Daylighting?Passive daylighting strategies promote the quantity and even distribution of daylight throughout a building by collecting natural light and reflecting itt into darker areas of the building. What makes this a “passive” strategy is that the design elements do not require any special mechanical equipment or energy sources. As soon as the sun rises, the passive
Answer: The most effective strategies for maximizing natural light in buildings include:

1. Building Orientation: Positioning the building to maximize light from the south, as it provides consistent sunlight throughout the day and year, is ideal. North-facing light is also beneficial, though in lower quantities. East and west orientations should be avoided due to harsh sunlight that only occurs during half the day.

2. Passive Daylighting Design Elements: These elements collect and reflect natural light into darker areas of the building without the need for mechanical equipment or energy sources. This includes using innovative reflective materials and advanced computer modeling to efficiently distribute light.

By implementing these strategies, architects can enhance the quantity and even distribution of natural light in buildings, contributing to sustainability and user wellness.

Answer: The context suggests that there is evidence of a potential link between cannabis use and an increase in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Studies have shown increased rates of cannabis-associated emergency department visits for psychosis and higher odds of psychosis-related hospitalization in areas where cannabis has been legalized. However, it also notes that whether cannabis plays a causal role in the onset of psychosis remains a point of controversy. Therefore, while there is some evidence suggesting that schizophrenia cases might increase with worldwide cannabis legalization, it is not definitively established, and the relationship remains a topic of debate.

Answer: The context provided suggests that there is evidence supporting a link between cannabis use and an increase in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Studies have shown a significant rise in cannabis-associated emergency department visits for psychosis and an increase in psychosis-related hospitalizations in areas where recreational cannabis has been legalized. Additionally, Mendelian randomization studies support a causal link between cannabis use and schizophrenia. Therefore, if cannabis were legalized worldwide, it is possible that cases of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders could increase, based on the trends observed in regions where cannabis has already been legalized.

Context: History of the Cockney Dialect

The Cockney dialect has a long and complex history. It is believed to have originated in the East End of London in the Middle Ages, among the working-class population who lived and worked in the city's crowded and noisy streets. The name Cockney is thought to have originally referred to those born within the sound of Bow Bells, the bells of St. Mary-le-Bow Church in Cheapside, London. Over time, the definition of a Cockney came to refer to anyone from the East End of London, regardless of whether they were actually born within earshot of the bells.

The Cockney dialect has undergone significant changes over the centuries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was heavily influenced by the influx of immigrants from France and the Netherlands, who brought with them their own linguistic influences. In the 18th century, there was a significant influence from the London underworld, which added many slang words and phrases to the dialect.

In the 19th century, Cockney was further influenced by the growth of the East End's Jewish community, who brought with them Yiddish words and phrases. The 20th century saw the continued evolution of the Cockney dialect, with the introduction of words and phrases from American popular culture and the influence of the media and the entertainment industry.

Despite the Cockney dialect having declined in recent years, it remains an important part of the cultural heritage of London and continues to be celebrated in literature, music, and popular culture.

What is a Cockney Accent?

The Cockney accent is a distinct dialect. It is known for its characteristic rhotic accent and use of non-standard grammar and vocabulary. Some of the features and characteristics of the Cockney accent include:

Rhoticity: Cockneys pronounce the "r" sound at the end of words, whereas many other accents in England do not. For example, the word "car" would be pronounced as "ca-r."

Vowel shifts: Cockneys often use different vowel sounds than those used in Standard English. For example, the "a" sound in words like "bath" or "dance" is pronounced as "ah," and the "o" sound in words like "dog" or "lot" is pronounced as "aw."

Use of glottal stops: Cockneys often replace the "t" sound at the end of words with a glottal stop, a sound made by the back of the tongue hitting the back of the throat. For example, "butter" would be pronounced as "bu-er."

Use of slang and rhyming slang: Cockneys use a lot of slang and rhyming slang, which can be difficult for outsiders to understand. For example, "apples and pears" means "stairs," and "Adam and Eve" means "believe."

The Cockney accent differs from the standard in other parts of England, generally referred to as "Received Pronunciation" or "RP." RP is considered to be the accent of educated speakers and is characterized by its precise vowel sounds and lack of the "h" sound at the beginning of words.

Examples of Cockney accents:

"I'm gonna take a butchers at that" (I'm going to take a look at that)

"Youse lot" (You people)

"I ain't got no money" (I don't have any money)

It is worth noting that, like any accent, Cockney accent varies from person to person, and it is not a monolithic thing; some people may have more or less accent than others.

Cockney Rhyming Slang

Cockney slang is a kind of coded language that uses words or phrases that rhyme with the word you want to say as a way of disguising it or making it more difficult for outsiders to understand.
Accent and dialect of English spoken in London

Cockney is an accent and dialect of the English language, mainly spoken in London and its environs, particularly by working-class and lower middle-class Londoners. The term Cockney is also used as a demonym for a person from the East End, or born within earshot of Bow Bells.

Estuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation, also widely spoken in and around London, as well as in wider South Eastern England. In multicultural areas of London, the Cockney dialect is, to an extent, being replaced by Multicultural London English—a new form of speech with significant Cockney influence.





Words and phrases [ edit ]

Etymology of Cockney [ edit ]

The earliest recorded use of the term is 1362 in passus VI of William Langland's Piers Plowman, where it is used to mean "a small, misshapen egg", from Middle English coken + ey ("a cock's egg").[10] Concurrently, the mythical land of luxury Cockaigne (attested from 1305) appeared under a variety of spellings, including Cockayne, Cocknay, and Cockney, and became humorously associated with the English capital London.[11][13]

The current meaning of Cockney comes from its use among rural Englishmen (attested in 1520) as a pejorative term for effeminate town-dwellers,[15][10] from an earlier general sense (encountered in "The Reeve's Tale" of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales c. 1386) of a "cokenay" as "a child tenderly brought up" and, by extension, "an effeminate fellow" or "a milksop".[16] This may have developed from the sources above or separately, alongside such terms as "cock" and "cocker" which both have the sense of "to make a nestle-cock ... or the darling of", "to indulge or pamper".[18][19] By 1600, this meaning of cockney was being particularly associated with the Bow Bells area.[20] In 1617, the travel writer Fynes Moryson stated in his Itinerary that "Londoners, and all within the sound of Bow Bells, are in reproach called Cockneys."[21] The same year, John Minsheu included the term in this newly restricted sense in his dictionary Ductor in Linguas.[25]

Other terms [ edit ]

: Refers to the archetype of a cheerful, talkative Cockney. Cockney diaspora : The term Cockney diaspora refers to the migration of Cockney speakers to places outside London, especially new towns. [26] It also refers to the descendants of those people, in areas where there was enough migration for identification with London to persist in subsequent generations.

It also refers to the descendants of those people, in areas where there was enough migration for identification with London to persist in subsequent generations. Mockney: Refers to a fake Cockney accent, though the term is sometimes also used as a self-deprecatory moniker by second, third, and subsequent generations of the Cockney diaspora.

Region [ edit ]

Initially, when London consisted of little more than the walled City, the term applied to all Londoners, and this lingered into the 19th century.[11] As the city grew, the definitions shifted to alternatives based on dialect or more specific areas; the East End and the area within earshot of Bow Bells.

The terms East End of London and within the sound of Bow bells are sometimes used interchangeably, symbolizing East End identity. The area within earshot of the bells changes with the wind, but there is a correlation between the two geographic definitions under the typical prevailing wind conditions. The term can apply to East Londoners who don't speak the dialect and those who do.[27]

London's East End [ edit ]

The traditional core districts of the East End include Middlesex towns of Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, Spitalfields, Stepney, Wapping, Limehouse, Poplar, Haggerston, Aldgate, Shoreditch, the Isle of Dogs, Hackney, Hoxton, Bow and Mile End. The informal definition of the East End gradually expanded to include towns in south-west Essex such as Forest Gate, East Ham, Leyton, Plaistow, Stratford, Walthamstow and West Ham as these formed part of London's growing conurbation.

Bow Bells' audible range [ edit ]

The church of St Mary-le-Bow is one of the oldest, largest, and historically most important churches in the City of London. The definition based on being born within earshot of the bells,[28] cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, reflects the early definition of the term as relating to all of London.

The audible range of the Bells is dependent on geography and wind conditions. The east is mostly low lying, a factor which combines with the strength and regularity of the prevailing wind, blowing from west-south-west for nearly three-quarters of the year,[29] to carry the sound further to the east, and more often. A 2012 study[30] showed that in the 19th century, and under typical conditions, the sound of the bells would carry as far as Clapton, Bow and Stratford in the east but only as far as Southwark to the south and Holborn in the west. An earlier study[31] suggested the sound would have carried even further. The 2012 study showed that in the modern era, noise pollution means that the bells can only be heard as far as Shoreditch. According to legend, Dick Whittington heard the bells 4.5 miles away at the Highgate Archway, in what is now north London. The studies mean that it is credible that Whittington might have heard them on one of the infrequent days that the wind blows from the south.

The church of St Mary-le-Bow was destroyed in 1666 by the Great Fire of London and rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren. Although the bells were destroyed again in 1941 in the Blitz, they had fallen silent on 13 June 1940 as part of the British anti-invasion preparations of World War II. Before they were replaced in 1961, there was a period when, by the "within earshot" definition, no "Bow Bell" Cockneys could be born.[32] The use of such a literal definition produces other problems since the area around the church is no longer residential, and the noise pollution means few are born within earshot.

Dialect [ edit ]

Cockney speakers have distinctive accents and dialects and occasionally use rhyming slang. The Survey of English Dialects took a recording from a long-time resident of Hackney in the 1950s, and the BBC made another recording in 1999 which showed how the accent had changed.[34][35] One of the characteristic pronunciations of Cockney is th-fronting.

The early development of Cockney vocabulary is obscure, but appears to have been heavily influenced by Essex and related eastern dialects, while borrowings from Yiddish, including kosher (originally Hebrew, via Yiddish, meaning legitimate) and shtum (/ʃtʊm/ originally German, via Yiddish, meaning mute),[37] as well as Romani, for example wonga (meaning money, from the Romani "wanga" meaning coal),[38] and cushty (Kushty) (from the Romani kushtipen, meaning good) reflect the influence of those groups on the development of the speech.

Recording from 1899 of "My Old Dutch" by Albert Chevalier, a music hall performer who based his material on life as a Cockney costermonger in Victorian London.

John Camden Hotten, in his Slang Dictionary of 1859, refers to "their use of a peculiar slang language" when describing the costermongers of London's East End.

Migration and evolution [ edit ]

A dialectological study of Leytonstone in 1964 found that the area's dialect was very similar to that recorded in Bethnal Green by Eva Sivertsen, but there were still some features that distinguished Leytonstone speech from Cockney.[39]

Linguistic research conducted in the early 2010s suggests that today, some aspects of the Cockney accent are declining in usage within multicultural areas, where some traditional features of Cockney have been displaced by Multicultural London English, a multiethnolect particularly common amongst young people from diverse backgrounds.[40] Nevertheless, the glottal stop, double negatives, and the vocalisation of the dark L (and other features of Cockney speech) are among the Cockney influences on Multicultural London English, and some rhyming slang terms are still in common usage.

An influential July 2010 report by Paul Kerswill, professor of sociolinguistics at Lancaster University, Multicultural London English: the emergence, acquisition, and diffusion of a new variety, predicted that the Cockney accent would disappear from London's streets within 30 years.[40] The study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, said that the accent, which has been around for more than 500 years, is being replaced in London by a new hybrid language. "Cockney in the East End is now transforming itself into Multicultural London English, a new, melting-pot mixture of all those people living here who learned English as a second language", Kerswill said.[40]

A series of new and expanded towns have often had a strong influence on local speech. Many areas beyond the capital have become Cockney-speaking to a greater or lesser degree, including the new towns of Hemel Hempstead, Basildon, and Harlow, and expanded towns such as Grays, Chelmsford and Southend. However, this is, except where least mixed, difficult to discern because of common features: linguistic historian and researcher of early dialects Alexander John Ellis in 1890 stated that Cockney developed owing to the influence of Essex dialect on London speech.

Writing in 1981, the dialectologist Peter Wright identified the building of the Becontree estate in Dagenham as influential in the spread of the Cockney dialect. This vast estate was built by the Corporation of London to house poor East Enders in a previously rural area of Essex. The residents typically kept their Cockney dialect rather than adopt an Essex dialect. Wright also reports that Cockney dialect spread along the main railway routes to towns in the surrounding counties as early as 1923, spreading further after World War II when many refugees left London owing to the bombing, and continuing to speak Cockney in their new homes.

A more distant example where the accent stands out is Thetford in Norfolk, which tripled in size from 1957 in a deliberate attempt to attract Londoners by providing social housing funded by the London County Council.[43]

Typical features [ edit ]

Closing diphthongs of Cockney on a vowel chart (from Mott (2012:77)). This chart gives only a general idea of the closing diphthongs of Cockney, as they are much more variable than the realizations shown on the chart. Two closing diphthongs are missing, namely /ɪi, ʊʉ/ .

Centering diphthongs of Cockney on a vowel chart (from Mott (2012:77))

As with many accents of the United Kingdom, Cockney is non-rhotic. A final -er is pronounced [ə] or lowered [ɐ] in broad Cockney. As with all or nearly all non-rhotic accents, the paired lexical sets COMM A and LETT ER , PALM/BATH and START , THOUGHT and NORTH/FORCE , are merged. Thus, the last syllable of words such as cheetah can be pronounced [ɐ] as well in broad Cockney.[45]

A broad /ɑː/ is used in words such as bath, path, demand. This originated in London in the 16th–17th centuries and is also part of Received Pronunciation (RP).

The accent features T-glottalisation, with use of the glottal stop as an allophone of /t/ in various positions, including after a stressed syllable. Glottal stops also occur, albeit less frequently for /k/ and /p/, and occasionally for mid-word consonants. For example, Richard Whiteing spelled "Hyde Park" as Hy' Par'. Like and light can be homophones. "Clapham" can be said as Cla'am (i. e., [ˈkl̥ɛʔm̩]). /t/ may also be flapped intervocalically, e.g. utter [ˈaɾə]. London /p, t, k/ are often aspirated in intervocalic and final environments, e.g., upper [ˈapʰə], utter [ˈatʰə], rocker [ˈɹɒkʰə], up [ˈaʔpʰ], out [ˈæə̯ʔtʰ], rock [ˈɹɒʔkʰ], where RP is traditionally described as having the unaspirated variants. Also, in broad cockney at least, the degree of aspiration is typically greater than in RP, and may often also involve some degree of affrication [pᶲʰ, tˢʰ, kˣʰ]. Affricatives may be encountered in initial, intervocalic, and final position. This feature results in Cockney being often mentioned in textbooks about Semitic languages while explaining how to pronounce the glottal stop.

Diphthong alterations in Cockney are:

/iː/ → [əi~ɐi] : [bəiʔ] "beet"

→ : "beet" /eɪ/ → [æɪ~aɪ] : [bæɪʔ] "bait"

→ : "bait" /aɪ/ → [ɑɪ] or even [ɒɪ] in "vigorous, dialectal" Cockney. The second element may be reduced or absent (with compensatory lengthening of the first element), so that there are variants such as [ɑ̟ə~ ɑ̟ː laugh - life , Barton - biting may become homophones: [lɑːf] , [bɑːʔn̩] .

Disyllabic [ɪi.ə, ɛi.ə, ɔu.ə, æi.ə] realizations of /iə, eə, ɔə, æʊ/ are also possible, and at least [ɛi.ə, ɔu.ə, æi.ə] are regarded as very strongly Cockney. Among these, the triphthongal realization of /ɔə/ occurs most commonly. There is not a complete agreement about the distribution of these; according to Wells (1982), they "occur in sentence-final position", whereas according to Mott (2012), these are "most common in final position".

The dialect uses the vocalisation of dark L, hence [ˈmɪowoː] for Millwall. The actual realization of a vocalized /l/ is influenced by surrounding vowels, and it may be realized as [u], [ʊ], [o] or [ɤ]. It is also transcribed as a semivowel [w] by some linguists, e.g., Coggle and Rosewarne. However, according to Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996), the vocalized dark l is sometimes an unoccluded lateral approximant, which differs from the RP [ɫ] only by the lack of the alveolar contact. Relatedly, there are many possible vowel neutralisations and absorptions in the context of a following dark L ([ɫ]) or its vocalized version; these include:

In broad Cockney, and to some extent in general popular London speech, a vocalized /l/ is entirely absorbed by a preceding /ɔː/ : e.g., salt and sort become homophones (although the contemporary pronunciation of salt /sɒlt/ [82] would prevent this from happening), and likewise fault - fought - fort , pause - Paul's , Morden - Malden , water - Walter . Sometimes such pairs are kept apart, in a more deliberate speech at least, by a kind of length difference: [ˈmɔʊdn̩] Morden vs. [ˈmɔʊːdn̩] Malden .

Sometimes such pairs are kept apart, in a more deliberate speech at least, by a kind of length difference: vs. . A preceding /ə/ is also fully absorbed into vocalised /l/ . The reflexes of earlier /əl/ and earlier /ɔː(l)/ are thus phonetically similar or identical; speakers are usually ready to treat them as the same phoneme. Thus awful can best be regarded as containing two occurrences of the same vowel, /ˈɔːfɔː/ . The difference between musical and music-hall , in an H -dropping broad Cockney, is thus nothing more than a matter of stress and perhaps syllable boundaries.

Thus rill , reel and real fall together in Cockney as [ɹɪɤ] ; while full and fool are [foʊ~fʊu] and may rhyme with cruel [ˈkʰɹʊu] .

In some broader types of Cockney, the neutralisation of /ʊ~uː~ʊə/ before non-prevocalic /l/ may also involve /ɔː/ , so that fall becomes homophonous with full and fool [fɔo] .

Thus, Sal and sale can be merged as [sæɤ] , fail and fowl as [fæɤ] , and Val , vale - veil and vowel as [væɤ] . The typical pronunciation of railway is [ˈɹæʊwæɪ] .

According to Siversten, /ɑː/ and /aɪ/ can also join in this neutralisation.

A neutralization discussed by Beaken (1971) and Bowyer (1973), but ignored by Siversten (1960), is that of /ɒ~əʊ~ʌ/ . It leads to the possibility of doll , dole and dull becoming homophonous as [dɒʊ] or [da̠ɤ] . Wells' impression is that the doll - dole neutralization is rather widespread in London, but that involving dull less so.

One further possible neutralization in the environment of a following non-prevocalic /l/ is that of /ɛ/ and /ɜː/ , so that well and whirl become homophonous as [wɛʊ] .

Cockney has been occasionally described as replacing /ɹ/ with /w/. For example, thwee (or fwee) instead of three, fwasty instead of frosty. Peter Wright, a Survey of English Dialects fieldworker, concluded that this was not a universal feature of Cockneys but that it was more common to hear this in the London area than elsewhere in Britain. This description may also be a result of mishearing the labiodental R as /w/, when it is still a distinct phoneme in Cockney.

An unstressed final -ow may be pronounced [ə]. In broad Cockney, this can be lowered to [ɐ].[45] This is common to most traditional, Southern English dialects except for those in the West Country.

Regarding grammar, Cockney uses me instead of my, for example, "At's me book you got 'ere". (where 'ere' means 'there'). It cannot be used when "my" is emphasized; e.g., "At's my book you got 'ere." It also uses the term ain't, as well as double negatives, for example "I didn't see nuffink".

By the 1980s and 1990s, most of the features mentioned above had partly spread into more general south-eastern speech, giving the accent called Estuary English; an Estuary speaker will use some but not all of the Cockney sounds.[86][87][88]

Perception [ edit ]

The Cockney accent has long been regarded as an indicator of low status. For example, in 1909 the Conference on the Teaching of English in London Elementary Schools issued by the London County Council, stating that "the Cockney mode of speech, with its unpleasant twang, is a modern corruption without legitimate credentials, and is unworthy of being the speech of any person in the capital city of the Empire".[89] Others defended the language variety: "The London dialect is really, especially on the South side of the Thames, a perfectly legitimate and responsible child of the old Kentish tongue [...] the dialect of London North of the Thames has been shown to be one of the many varieties of the Midland or Mercian dialect, flavoured by the East Anglian variety of the same speech".[89] Since then, the Cockney accent has been more accepted as an alternative form of the English language rather than a lesser one, though the low status mark remains. In the 1950s, the only accent to be heard on the BBC (except in entertainment programs such as The Sooty Show) was the RP of Standard English, whereas nowadays many different accents, including Cockney or accents heavily influenced by it, can be heard on the BBC.[90] In a survey of 2,000 people conducted by Coolbrands in the autumn of 2008, Cockney was voted equal fourth coolest accent in Britain with 7% of the votes, while The Queen's English was considered the coolest, with 20% of the votes.[91] Brummie was voted least popular, receiving just 2%. The Cockney accent often featured in films produced by Ealing Studios and was frequently portrayed as the typical British accent of the lower classes in movies by Walt Disney, though this was only so in London.

Spread [ edit ]

Studies have indicated that the heavy use of South East England accents on television and radio may cause the spread of Cockney English since the 1960s.[92][93][94][95] Cockney is more and more influential and some claim that in the future many features of the accent may become standard.[96]

Scotland [ edit ]

Studies have indicated that working-class adolescents in areas such as Glasgow have begun to use certain aspects of Cockney and other Anglicisms in their speech.[97] infiltrating the traditional Glasgow patter.[98] For example, TH-fronting is commonly found, and typical Scottish features such as the postvocalic /r/ are reduced.[99] Research suggests the use of English speech characteristics is likely to be a result of the influence of London and South East England accents featuring heavily on television, such as the popular BBC One soap opera EastEnders.[92][93][94][95] However, such claims have been criticized.[100]

England [ edit ]

Certain features of cockney – Th-fronting, L-vocalisation, T-glottalisation, and the fronting of the GOAT and GOOSE vowels – have spread across the south-east of England and, to a lesser extent, to other areas of Britain.[101] However, Clive Upton has noted that these features have occurred independently in some other dialects, such as TH-fronting in Yorkshire and L-vocalisation in parts of Scotland.[102]

The term Estuary English has been used to describe London pronunciations slightly closer to RP than Cockney. The variety first came to public prominence in an article by David Rosewarne in the Times Educational Supplement in October 1984.[103] Rosewarne argued that it may eventually replace Received Pronunciation in the south-east. The phonetician John C. Wells collected media references to Estuary English on a website. Writing in April 2013, Wells argued that research by Joanna Przedlacka "demolished the claim that EE was a single entity sweeping the southeast. Rather, we have various sound changes emanating from working-class London speech, each spreading independently".[104]

Pearly tradition [ edit ]

The Pearly Kings and Queens are famous as an East End institution, but that perception is not wholly correct as they are found in other places across London, including Peckham and Penge in south London.[citation needed]

A costume associated with Cockneys is that of the pearly King or Queen, worn by London costermongers who sew thousands of pearl buttons onto their clothing in elaborate and creative patterns.

It represents what researchers expect to find in a study or experiment. In situations where the hypothesis is unsupported by the research, the research still has value.

The scientific method involves the following steps:\\n\\nForming a question Performing background research Creating a hypothesis Designing an experiment Collecting data Analyzing the results Drawing conclusions Communicating the results\\n\\nThe hypothesis is a prediction, but it involves more than a guess. Most of the time, the hypothesis begins with a question which is then explored through background research. It is only at this point that researchers begin to develop a testable hypothesis. Unless you are creating an exploratory study, your hypothesis should always explain what you expect to happen.\\n\\nIn a study exploring the effects of a particular drug, the hypothesis might be that researchers expect the drug to have some type of effect on the symptoms of a specific illness. In psychology, the hypothesis might focus on how a certain aspect of the environment might influence a particular behavior.\\n\\nRemember, a hypothesis does not have to be correct. While the hypothesis predicts what the researchers expect to see, the goal of the research is to determine whether this guess is right or wrong. When conducting an experiment, researchers might explore a number of factors to determine which ones might contribute to the ultimate outcome.\\n\\nIn many cases, researchers may find that the results of an experiment do not support the original hypothesis. When writing up these results, the researchers might suggest other options that should be explored in future studies.\\n\\nHypothesis Format\\n\\nIn many cases, researchers might draw a hypothesis from a specific theory or build on previous research. For example, prior research has shown that stress can impact the immune system. So a researcher might hypothesize: "People with high-stress levels will be more likely to contract a common cold after being exposed to the virus than people who have low-stress levels."\\n\\nIn other instances, researchers might look at commonly held beliefs or folk wisdom. "Birds of a feather flock together" is one example of folk wisdom that a psychologist might try to investigate. The researcher might pose a specific hypothesis that "People tend to select romantic partners who are similar to them in interests and educational level."\\n\\nElements of a Good Hypothesis\\n\\nSo how do you write a good hypothesis? When trying to come up with a hypothesis for your research or experiments, ask yourself the following questions:\\n\\nIs your hypothesis based on your research on a topic?\\n\\nCan your hypothesis be tested?\\n\\nDoes your hypothesis include independent and dependent variables?\\n\\nBefore you come up with a specific hypothesis, spend some time doing background research. Once you have completed a literature review, start thinking about potential questions you still have. Pay attention to the discussion section in the journal articles you read. Many authors will suggest questions that still need to be explored.\\n\\nTo form a hypothesis, you should take these steps:\\n\\nCollect as many observations about a topic or problem as you can.\\n\\nEvaluate these observations and look for possible causes of the problem.\\n\\nCreate a list of possible explanations that you might want to explore.\\n\\nAfter you have developed some possible hypotheses, think of ways that you could confirm or disprove each hypothesis through experimentation. This is known as falsifiability.\\n\\nFalsifiability of a Hypothesis\\n\\nIn the scientific method, falsifiability is an important part of any valid hypothesis.\\ufeff\\ufeff In order to test a claim scientifically, it must be possible that the claim could be proven false.\\n\\nStudents sometimes confuse the idea of falsifiability with the idea that it means that something is false, which is not the case. What falsifiability means is that if something was false, then it is possible to demonstrate that it is false.\\n\\nOne of the hallmarks of pseudoscience is that it makes claims that cannot be refuted or proven false.\\n\\nOperational Definitions\\n\\nA variable is a factor or element that can be changed and manipulated in ways that are observable and measurable. However, the researcher must also define how the variable will be manipulated and measured in the study.\\n\\nFor example, a researcher might operationally define the variable "test anxiety" as the results of a self-report measure of anxiety experienced during an exam. A "study habits" variable might be defined by the amount of studying that actually occurs as measured by time.\\n\\nThese precise descriptions are important because many things can be measured in a number of different ways. One of the basic principles of any type of scientific research is that the results must be replicable.\\ufeff\\ufeff By clearly detailing the specifics of how the variables were measured and manipulated, other researchers can better understand the results and repeat the study if needed.\\n\\nSome variables are more difficult than others to define. How would you operationally define a variable such as aggression? For obvious ethical reasons, researchers cannot create a situation in which a person behaves aggressively toward others.\\n\\nIn order to measure this variable, the researcher must devise a measurement that assesses aggressive behavior without harming other people. In this situation, the researcher might utilize a simulated task to measure aggressiveness.\\n\\nHypothesis Checklist Does your hypothesis focus on something that you can actually test?\\n\\nDoes your hypothesis include both an independent and dependent variable?\\n\\nCan you manipulate the variables?\\n\\nCan your hypothesis be tested without violating ethical standards?\\n\\nTypes of Hypotheses\\n\\nThe hypothesis you use will depend on what you are investigating and hoping to find. Some of the main types of hypotheses that you might use include:\\n\\nSimple hypothesis : This type of hypothesis suggests that there is a relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable.\\n\\n: This type of hypothesis suggests that there is a relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable. Complex hypothesis : This type of hypothesis suggests a relationship between three or more variables, such as two independent variables and a dependent variable.\\n\\n: This type of hypothesis suggests a relationship between three or more variables, such as two independent variables and a dependent variable. Null hypothesis : This hypothesis suggests no relationship exists between two or more variables.\\n\\n: This hypothesis suggests no relationship exists between two or more variables. Alternative hypothesis : This hypothesis states the opposite of the null hypothesis.\\n\\n: This hypothesis states the opposite of the null hypothesis. Statistical hypothesis : This hypothesis uses statistical analysis to evaluate a representative sample of the population and then generalizes the findings to the larger group.\\n\\n: This hypothesis uses statistical analysis to evaluate a representative sample of the population and then generalizes the findings to the larger group. Logical hypothesis: This hypothesis assumes a relationship between variables without collecting data or evidence.\\n\\n\\n\\nHypotheses Examples\\n\\nA hypothesis often follows a basic format of "If {this happens} then {this will happen}." One way to structure your hypothesis is to describe what will happen to the dependent variable if you change the independent variable.\\n\\nThe basic format might be: "If {these changes are made to a certain independent variable}, then we will observe {a change in a specific dependent variable}."\\n\\nA few examples of simple hypotheses:\\n\\n"Students who eat breakfast will perform better on a math exam than students who do not eat breakfast."\\n\\nComplex hypothesis: "Students who experience test anxiety before an English exam will get lower scores than students who do not experience test anxiety."\\u200b\\n\\n"Motorists who talk on the phone while driving will be more likely to make errors on a driving course than those who do not talk on the phone."\\n\\nExamples of a complex hypothesis include:\\n\\n"People with high-sugar diets and sedentary activity levels are more likely to develop depression."\\n\\n"Younger people who are regularly exposed to green, outdoor areas have better subjective well-being than older adults who have limited exposure to green spaces."\\n\\nExamples of a null hypothesis include:\\n\\n"Children who receive a new reading intervention will have scores different than students who do not receive the intervention."\\n\\n"There will be no difference in scores on a memory recall task between children and adults."\\n\\nExamples of an alternative hypothesis:\\n\\n"Children who receive a new reading intervention will perform better than students who did not receive the intervention."\\n\\n"Adults will perform better on a memory task than children."\\n\\nCollecting Data on Your Hypothesis\\n\\nOnce a researcher has formed a testable hypothesis, the next step is to select a research design and start collecting data.

GraphRAG Score: 109Question: I am trying to build a Sign Language translation system, but there is not enough data to train a model. How should I recollect and tag the data so that it is diverse enough and also is possible to use to test or train other systems?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: A sign language translation system can break the communication barrier between hearing-impaired people and others. In this paper, a novel American sign language (ASL) translation method based on wearable sensors was proposed. We leveraged inertial sensors to capture signs and surface electromyography (EMG) sensors to detect facial expressions. We applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from input signals. Then, long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer models were exploited to achieve end-to-end translation from input signals to text sentences. We evaluated two models on 40 ASL sentences strictly following the rules of grammar. Word error rate (WER) and sentence error rate (SER) are utilized as the evaluation standard. The LSTM model can translate sentences in the testing dataset with a 7.74% WER and 9.17% SER. The transformer model performs much better by achieving a 4.22% WER and 4.72% SER. The encouraging results indicate that both models are suitable for sign language translation with high accuracy. With complete motion capture sensors and facial expression recognition methods, the sign language translation system has the potential to recognize more sentences.

Introduction

Sign language is the main communication method among hearing-impaired people. According to the World Federation of the Deaf, there are 70 million deaf people around the world using sign language in their daily life. As a kind of natural language, sign language has not become a mainstream Research Topic in natural language processing (NLP), although the machine translation of spoken or written language is highly accurate today. However, the research on machine translation with deep learning models provides development direction and innovative methods for sign language translation tasks. To further research on end-to-end translation, it is necessary to consider the application of deep learning models (Bing et al., 2021a,b,c, 2022).

Previous works about sign language translation mainly fall into two categories: vision-based and wearable sensor-based methods. Vision-based methods exploit cameras to capture features of the hands (Koller et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2017). One most commonly used dataset is RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather (Koller et al., 2015), which contains 3 years' sign language interpretation of daily news and weather forecast from a German public TV-station. With this dataset, a machine translation model with an encoder-decoder structure was built that included both long short-term memory (LSTM) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) as the decoder (Pu et al., 2019). The transformer-based architecture was applied to make the model trainable in an end-to-end manner (Camgoz et al., 2020). A continuous sign recognition framework named Hierarchical Attention Network with Latent Space (LS-HAN) was proposed (Huang et al., 2018). Another well-known dataset is Chinese Sign Language (CSL) (Zhou et al., 2019). This dataset containing 100 continuous Chinese sign language sentences was collected by the Kinect device. A novel architecture with cross-modality augmentation reached state-of-the-art translation accuracy (Pu et al., 2020).

In wearable sensor-based research, devices, such as data gloves, wristwatches, or armbands, are the mainstream for data collection (Cheng et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2016). Inertial data and surface electromyography (EMG) data were collected from forearms to detect hand/arm gestures (Wu et al., 2016). In total, 80 commonly used American sign language (ASL) signs were classified by a support vector machine classifier. An ASL translation system named MyoSign was presented using the MYO armband as a data collection device (Zhang et al., 2019). The end-to-end translation model consisted of convolutional neural network (CNN), LSTM, and CTC layers. In total, 100 sentences that comprised of 70 commonly used ASL words without considering sign language grammar were translated with more than 92% accuracy. Another work using the MYO armband collected data from 20 ASL sentences and treated it as a classification task (Tateno et al., 2020). The LSTM classifier could recognize these twenty motions with high accuracy among twenty participants. With one sample entropy-based feature set for both accelerometer and EMG, 60 isolated Greek Sign Language signs were recognized with an accuracy of 93% (Kosmidou and Hadjileontiadis, 2009). The combination of the MYO armband and Leap Motion camera was used to estimate continuous hand position (Quivira et al., 2018). Combining deep learning with principal component analysis (PCA), the grasp of a prosthetic hand was controlled (Li et al., 2018).

Sign languages are not exactly expressed with hands. It is also critical to catch facial expressions. For example, raising eyebrows means an open-ended question in ASL (Bragg et al., 2019). In video-based translation, it is easy to catch the movements of hands and face with a camera simultaneously. However, a few studies have considered facial expressions as important information. For wearable sensors, facial EMG data are widely used in emotional classification. Five different facial emotions were classified with 2-channel EMG sensors and a CNN classifier (Kehri and Awale, 2020). Emotion recognition with EMG measurements of the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscles was studied to identify happy, angry, and neutral faces (Kulke et al., 2020). In naturalistic studies, facial EMG signals can also be used to assess subjective emotional valence. Wearable devices with EMG electrodes were developed to record participants' facial changes while viewing emotional films (Sato et al., 2021). With the evaluation of facial EMG, emotional facial expressions in real-life social interactions were more evocative of reactions than experimental conditions (Hsu et al., 2020).

In summary, with deep learning models, both vision-based and wearable sensor-based methods can translate human movements into text sentences during sign language performance. The vision-based works tend to build and train the model on benchmarks with advanced algorithms and data augmentation. Wearable sensor-based topics always collect data by themselves due to different kinds of devices applied in experiments. With only EMG signals from forearms, limited sign language words or sentences can be recognized accurately. After adding the data from inertial measurement units (IMU), results are significantly improved (Zhang et al., 2019).

In our work, we have applied IMU signals from forearms and hands to translate 40 ASL sentences into texts following the grammar rules. To realize end-to-end translation, two kinds of encoder-decoder structured models in NLP are included: the LSTM-based model and transformer-based model. To acquire more information, facial expression data collected by EMG sensors are also regarded as a part of the input to translation models. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first collected IMU and EMG signals and did signal preprocessing. Then we presented LSTM and transformer models and trained the models with the dataset. The models were evaluated by the testing dataset, and the significance of the EMG signal was discussed. Finally, the discussion and conclusion of the paper were drawn.

Materials and Methods

ASL Specifics

American sign language is a kind of visual language expressed via a sequence of sign gestures. A sign consists of four main components, i.e., hand shape, movement, palm orientation, and location. In addition, facial expression can also be critical to express the signer's current mood. For example, raised eyebrow always indicates asking a question and a neutral face conveys a statement of fact. In addition to neutrality and questioning, positive and negative emotions are also considered in this research. In total, 40 commonly used sentences (listed in Table 1) with emotions positive, negative, questioning, and neutral were selected for recognition. These 40 sentences come from popular sign language videos on the Internet. The signers perform these sentences with obvious facial expressions.

Dataset Collection

The movements of forearms and hands were obtained by the Perception Neuron Motion Capture System. As shown in Figure 1A, this system is based on wearable IMU sensors named “Neuron.” Each Neuron is composed of an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. There are 25 Neurons for capturing upper body movements. The motion capture system needs to communicate with the Axis Neuron software. Axis Neuron can receive and process the data from all IMU sensors and export it into a .bvh format file. In this file, skeleton information and movement information of the whole process are recorded. We have only used the motion data, which record the rotation information of all joints of the human body. We have only focused on the data from hands and forearms' joints. The sampling rate was 60 Hz.

FIGURE 1

Figure 1. Devices for data collection: (A) perception Neuron motion capture system; (B) electromyography (EMG) signal acquisition system.

Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity generated by the muscle. Figure 1B shows a 2-channel EMG signal acquisition system. The system mainly includes an NI data collector and differential electrodes. The NI USB-6008 provides eight single-ended analog inputs. Four single-ended analog inputs were used to form two differential channels. Another grounded channel was used as a reference. The electrode applied in this system was wet silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) surface electrode. The useful information of EMG signals was mainly distributed in the frequency range of 0–500 Hz (De Luca et al., 2010). To meet the Nyquist sampling theorem, the sampling rate was chosen as 1 kHz.

In the experiment, EMG signals from zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii areas and IMU signals from forearms and hands were collected. Three participants with the right hand as the dominant hand participated in data collection. The signers performed each sign language sentence with both hand movements and facial expressions. Participant 1 contributed the largest amount of data (1,600 samples). Participants 2 and 3 each contributed 400 samples. Finally, there were 60 samples for each sentence and 2,400 samples in total in the dataset.

Data Pre-Processing

The .bvh data from the IMU motion capture system includes all the motion data of 59 bones. We had only focused on the data from hands and forearms. Finger spacing was fixed in Axis Neuron software; as a result, some channels maintained the same values throughout the experiment. We manually removed these channels that contained no useful information. Finally, only 38 channels were remained for the inertial data of forearms and hands. Since the IMU signals were sampled with a much lower sampling rate, we only used a median filter with a kernel size of 5 to make data smooth. The signal preprocessing flow is shown in Figure 2.

FIGURE 2

Figure 2. Signal preprocessing flowchart.

When compared to IMU, the EMG signal was much noisier and unstable. To maintain the performance of EMG features, the signal was band-passed and notch filtered to remove power-line interference and motion artifacts (Phinyomark et al., 2009). Then, a median filter was used to smooth the data. Rectification is a commonly applied approach to magnify the EMG features (Yang et al., 2016). The Root-Mean-Square rectification of signal x(t) is defined as

E M G r e c t ( t ) = 1 T ∫ t − T T x 2 ( τ ) d τ

Where T is the window size that controls the trade-off between smooth envelopes against transient variations of EMG signal. We set this value to be 0.02 s to avoid signal distortion and to keep approximately consistent in length with the IMU signal according to the sampling rates of the two devices. The lengths between EMG and the corresponding IMU signal may be different, so we resampled the EMG to the same length as IMU in the final step of preprocessing. An example of the EMG data from sentence no. 21 before and after preprocessing is shown in Figure 3.

Facial Expressions Classifier

Convolutional neural network is an effective technique to solve signal and image classification problems. Based on shared-weights architecture, CNN eliminates effects from motion differences in amplitude and trajectory (LeCun et al., 1998). An emotional classifier using CNN as a feature extractor was proposed in this research.

The CNN classifier mainly consists of four layers as shown in Figure 4. The first two layers are convolutional layers with 9 × 1 and 5 × 1 kernels, respectively. Since the input EMG signal contains two independent channels, to avoid any confusion, the convolutional kernels are both 1-D kernels. Batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) was used for reducing internal covariate shift, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) was selected as the activation function. Max pooling was set to reduce the computational burden. The following layer is a fully connected layer with a dropout strategy to prevent overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). Finally, there is a fully connected layer with G-way softmax. G is the number of facial expressions to be recognized.

FIGURE 4

Figure 4. Facial expressions' classification model.

Sign Language Translation Models

In the sign language dataset, the continuous signal stream for each sentence lasts for around 3–10 s. With the sliding window method, the long signal stream is segmented into a sequence of frames. Since the sampling rate of the motion capture system was 60 Hz, the window size we set was 600 ms (36 sample points) and the sliding size was 300 ms (18 sample points).

The label for collected EMG and IMU data was the corresponding text sentence. There were 40 sentences in the dataset that consisted of words and punctuation. We built a vocabulary at the word level and used the index of the word as the label. The vocabulary is shown in Table 2. Three kinds of special words were added to vocabulary: <BOS>, <EOS>, and <PAD> (indicated “begin of sentence,” “end of sentence,” and “padding”). We added <BOS> and <EOS> to the beginning and end of each sentence in the dataset and then padded the sentence to the same length with <PAD>. Finally, text sentences were changed into sequences of words' indices.

LSTM Translation Model

The first model is based on LSTM. As illustrated in Figure 5, the first layer of the encoder is CNN. The CNN layer extracts superior representations of features from input data frames as introduced in Section Facial Expressions Classifier. The input signal of stacked IMU and EMG had 40 channels, so the convolutional kernels we used here were 2-D kernels with the shape of 3 × 3.

FIGURE 5

Figure 5. Architecture of long short-term memory (LSTM)-based translation model.

The second layer of the encoder is LSTM. LSTM is widely used in speech recognition, language modeling, and translation to model temporal dependence. As an extended model of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), LSTM can preserve the long-term dependencies by controlling the percentage of previous information dropping, current information inputting, and current information outputting (Shi et al., 2015). Figure 6 shows the LSTM expanded by time step and the detailed structure of the LSTM unit.

FIGURE 6

Figure 6. Detailed structure of long short-term memory (LSTM) unit.

The cell state C t−1 and hidden state h t−1 from the previous time step along with the current input x t are the inputs to the current LSTM unit. The forget gate f t , input gate i t , update gate C t ~ , and output o t are calculated as follows:

f t = σ ( W f · [ h t - 1 , x t ] + b f ) i t = σ ( W i · [ h t - 1 , x t ] + b i ) C t ~ = tanh ( W C · [ h t - 1 , x t ] + b c ) o t = σ ( W o · [ h t - 1 , x t ] + b o )

Where σ is the sigmoid function, and W are b are weights and bias, respectively. With these results, C t and h t are updated:

C t = f t * C t - 1 + i t * C t ~ h t = o t * tanh ( C t )

The hidden vectors C t and h t passed to the decoder were used as the initial hidden state of decoder LSTM. Given the special word <BOS>, the decoder started to output predicting results step by step. If the output of a time step was turned to <EOS>, the whole predicting procedure should be finished.

Transformer Translation Model

The transformer model has been used successfully in a variety of tasks, such as reading comprehension, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations (Vaswani et al., 2017). With the self-attention mechanism, the model can draw global dependencies between input and output without considering the distance. The architecture of the transformer-based translation model is shown in Figure 7A.

FIGURE 7

Figure 7. Transformer-based translation model: (A) architecture of the model; (B) detailed structure of the self-attention layer.

In the encoder section, the input to the self-attention layer consists of two parts: features' sequence extracted from the CNN layer and positional encoding recording the sequence order. The detailed structure of the self-attention layer is shown in Figure 7B. Query, key, and value all come from the same input by performing different linear transformations:

Q = W Q · x K = W K · x V = W V · x

The attention score is calculated as:

s c o r e s = s o f t m a x ( Q · K T d k )

Where d k is the dimension of K. The output of the self-attention layer is matrix multiplication between score and value matrix V:

A t t e n t i o n ( Q , K , V ) = s c o r e s · V

After going through layer normalization and feed-forward module, the input was finally encoded into a hidden vector.

In the model's training step, the input of the decoder was a text sentence. In the masked self-attention layer, the model could only attend to the output words that had been predicted before. The encoder-decoder cross-attention layer includes K and V from encoder output and Q from decoder input. The calculation method is the same as self-attention. The output of the decoder is the probabilities of all possible words in the vocabulary. With the greedy search decoding method (Edmonds, 1971), we chose the word with the largest probability as the model prediction.

Results

Facial Expressions Classification

We validated the CNN classifier with 5-fold cross-validation. The dataset of EMG signals that contained 2,400 samples was randomly divided into five subsets. We left each subset as the validation set and trained the model with the remaining four subsets. This process was repeated five times. The loss function of the model was cross-entropy loss and the optimizer was Adam with a learning rate of 0.001. According to the recognition results of validation sets, the classification accuracy is calculated as given below:

A c c u r a c y = N u m b e r o f c o r r e c t c l a s s i f i c a t i o n s T o t a l n u m b e r o f v a l i d a t i o n s a m p l e s

After training the model, the classification results of all cross-validation sets are shown in Figure 8A. The accuracy of more than 99% illustrates that EMG features are significantly different in four kinds of facial expressions. The confusion matrix accumulated from all cross-validation steps is shown in Figure 8B.

FIGURE 8

Sign Language Translation

We randomly divided 2,400 samples in the dataset into a training set (70%, 1,680 samples), validation set (15%, 360 samples), and testing set (15%, 360 samples). We used data in the training set to train the model and then adjusted parameters with the validation set to select the model with the best performance. The training loss is cross-entropy between model prediction and real labeled sentences. The optimizer is Adam with a learning rate of 0.0003.

On the testing set, we employed word error rate (WER) and sentence error rate (SER) as the evaluation of the model. WER measures the least operations of substitution, deletion, and insertion to transform the predicted sentence into the ground truth sentence:

W E R = N s u b + N d e l + N i n s N g r o u n d t r u t h w o r d s

Where N sub , N del , and N ins are numbers of required substitutions, deletions, and insertions, respectively. SER measures the percentage of not completely correct sentences of the model's testing prediction results:

S E R = N e r r o r s e n t e n c e s N g r o u n d t r u t h s e n t e n c e s

In the training step of the LSTM translation model, the losses of training and validation set were both dropped dramatically in the first few epochs. After 15 epochs of training, the model tended to converge with a loss of nearly 0. We stopped training the model at epoch 20 and evaluated it with the testing set. Figure 9 shows the evaluation result of the LSTM translation model on the testing dataset. The blue bars are the sentence amount distribution of 40 sign language sentences in the testing set and the orange bars show the error sentences amount. Most sentences were predicted correctly by the model. The SER we calculated was 9.17% (33 error sentences of 360 samples) and the WER was 7.74% (43 del errors, 17 ins errors, and 87 sub errors of 1,898 words).

FIGURE 9

Figure 9. Long short-term memory (LSTM) model evaluation result.

The transformer translation model converges much faster, so we trained the model for only 15 epochs. The evaluation result is shown in Figure 10. This model performs much better than the LSTM model in the testing dataset. There were only 17 error sentences from 360 sentences in the dataset and thus the SER was 4.72%. The WER was calculated to be 4.21% (33 del errors and 47 sub errors of 1,898 words).

Discussion

Significance of EMG

In this work, EMG signals from facial areas provided four kinds of emotional information during sign language performance. Combining EMG and IMU data as input provides the model with more information to achieve better prediction results. To evaluate the significance of EMG, we removed the EMG data from the input and then trained the translation models again with only IMU data.

The comparisons between input with or without EMG are shown in Tables 3, 4. WERs of the two models increase by 4.12 and 4.21% without EMG data as input, and SERs also increase by 5.55 and 4.17%, respectively. Both models gave more wrong predictions, but the transformer model still performed much better than the LSTM model at a 3.43% lower error rate at the word level and 5.83% lower error rate at the sentence level.

User-Independent Validation

We evaluated the performance of models in user-independent conditions. Three participants participated in this experiment. Participant 1 who contributed the largest amount of data (1,600 samples) was always used as a part of the training set. Participants 2 (400 samples) and 3 (400 samples) were regarded as testing sets, respectively. The results are shown in Table 5. In the sign language translation task, both WER and SER increased dramatically to more than 40%. Due to different habits and amplitudes of each person's sign language performances, there were great differences between the movement data in user-independent validation. The method we proposed could still translate more than half of the sentences in the testing set accurately. In the user-independent validation of facial expression classification with EMG, the accuracy remained at a high level of more than 93%. The result illustrated that the EMG signals of four different expressions had distinguishable features.

Table 5. User-independent validation results.

Limitations

The dataset contains limited sentences and participants. Only four kinds of facial expressions were considered, as a result, the CNN classifier gave high-accurate results on this four-category classification task. LSTM and transformer are two commonly used models in NLP research. Instead of text or speech, the input of sign language is signals from the human body. The transformer model outperforms the LSTM model. The transformer is originally proposed to solve the sequential order problem of RNN (Vaswani et al., 2017). The LSTM model can only read input from left to right or from right to left, but the transformer considers the overall input content at the same time. With EMG as a part of the input, the accuracy of the model prediction improves. EMG can enhance the model's translation ability. In user-independent validation, the translation accuracy dropped dramatically due to the significant inter-individual differences in movement. More participants should be involved in the experiment and the model should learn knowledge from more data.

Compared with visual methods of sign language translation, a camera is more portable but will encounter background and perspective problems. Even the most popular Kinect camera with skeleton tracking function cannot extract the detailed skeleton structure of hands. To some extent, wearable IMU sensors are more reliable. The IMU-based motion capture device for the upper body contains 25 sensors. It is a unitary device and cannot be disassembled. This motion capture system is bulky for a translation system with only 40 sentences, but it has the potential to recognize more sentences. A larger dataset using this device is in preparation and machine-learning algorithms more suitable for wearables are being developed.

Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a wearable sensor-based sign language translation method considering both hands' movements and facial expressions. IMU and EMG signals were preprocessed and segmented into a sequence of frames as the input of translation models. We classified facial expressions with EMG data only. Then we built encoder-decoder models to realize end-to-end sign language translation from signals to text sentences. Two kinds of end-to-end models based on LSTM and transformer were trained and evaluated by the collected dataset. WER and SER were used to compare the translation ability of models. Both models could translate 40 ASL sentences with high accuracy and the transformer-based model performed better than LSTM. The special role of EMG was verified with both facial expressions' classification and models' performance after removing EMG from the input. The translation accuracy in user-independent conditions was evaluated.

Sign Language Translator enables the hearing impaired user to communicate efficiently in sign language, and the application will translate the same into text/speech. The user has to train the model, by recording its own sign language gestures. Internally it uses MobileNet and KNN classifier to classify the gestures.
Answer: To build a diverse and effective Sign Language translation system, you can follow these steps for data collection and tagging:

1. **Diverse Participant Recruitment**: Involve a wide range of participants with different signing styles, speeds, and expressions. This will help capture the variability in sign language usage.

2. **Comprehensive Sentence Selection**: Choose a variety of sentences that cover different grammatical structures, vocabulary, and expressions. Include sentences with different emotions such as positive, negative, questioning, and neutral.

3. **Use of Wearable Sensors**: Utilize wearable sensors like inertial measurement units (IMUs) and electromyography (EMG) sensors to capture both hand movements and facial expressions. This will provide a richer dataset that includes both motion and emotional context.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that the collected data is preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts. Use techniques like filtering and normalization to prepare the data for model training.

5. **Labeling and Tagging**: Label the data with corresponding text sentences, including special tokens for the beginning and end of sentences. Ensure that the labels are consistent and accurately reflect the sign language gestures.

6. **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure that the model is tested on diverse data subsets. This will help in evaluating the model's performance across different signing styles.

7. **User-Independent Validation**: Test the model with data from participants not included in the training set to evaluate its generalization ability.

Context: [RetrieverResultItem(content='{\'id\': \':0\', \'index\': 0, \'text\': "A sign language translation system can break the communication barrier between hearing-impaired people and others. In this paper, a novel American sign language (ASL) translation method based on wearable sensors was proposed. We leveraged inertial sensors to capture signs and surface electromyography (EMG) sensors to detect facial expressions. We applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from input signals. Then, long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer models were exploited to achieve end-to-end translation from input signals to text sentences. We evaluated two models on 40 ASL sentences strictly following the rules of grammar. Word error rate (WER) and sentence error rate (SER) are utilized as the evaluation standard. The LSTM model can translate sentences in the testing dataset with a 7.74% WER and 9.17% SER. The transformer model performs much better by achieving a 4.22% WER and 4.72% SER. The encouraging results indicate that both models are suitable for sign language translation with high accuracy. With complete motion capture sensors and facial expression recognition methods, the sign language translation system has the potential to recognize more sentences.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nSign language is the main communication method among hearing-impaired people. According to the World Federation of the Deaf, there are 70 million deaf people around the world using sign language in their daily life. As a kind of natural language, sign language has not become a mainstream Research Topic in natural language processing (NLP), although the machine translation of spoken or written language is highly accurate today. However, the research on machine translation with deep learning models provides development direction and innovative methods for sign language translation tasks. To further research on end-to-end translation, it is necessary to consider the application of deep learning models (Bing et al., 2021a,b,c, 2022).\\n\\nPrevious works about sign language translation mainly fall into two categories: vision-based and wearable sensor-based methods. Vision-based methods exploit cameras to capture features of the hands (Koller et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2017). One most commonly used dataset is RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather (Koller et al., 2015), which contains 3 years\' sign language interpretation of daily news and weather forecast from a German public TV-station. With this dataset, a machine translation model with an encoder-decoder structure was built that included both long short-term memory (LSTM) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) as the decoder (Pu et al., 2019). The transformer-based architecture was applied to make the model trainable in an end-to-end manner (Camgoz et al., 2020). A continuous sign recognition framework named Hierarchical Attention Network with Latent Space (LS-HAN) was proposed (Huang et al., 2018). Another well-known dataset is Chinese Sign Language (CSL) (Zhou et al., 2019). This dataset containing 100 continuous Chinese sign language sentences was collected by the Kinect device. A novel architecture with cross-modality augmentation reached state-of-the-art translation accuracy (Pu et al., 2020).\\n\\nIn wearable sensor-based research, devices, such as data gloves, wristwatches, or armbands, are the mainstream for data collection (Cheng et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2016). Inertial data and surface electromyography (EMG) data were collected from forearms to detect hand/arm gestures (Wu et al., 2016). In total, 80 commonly used American sign language (ASL) signs were classified by a support vector machine classifier. An ASL translation system named MyoSign was presented using the MYO armband as a data collection device (Zhang et al., 2019). The end-to-end translation model consisted of convolutional neural network (CNN), LSTM, and CTC layers. In total, 100 sentences that comprised of 70 commonly used ASL words without considering sign language grammar were translated with more than 92% accuracy. Another work using the MYO armband collected data from 20 ASL sentences and treated it as a classification task (Tateno et al., 2020). The LSTM classifier could recognize these twenty motions with high accuracy among twenty participants. With one sample entropy-based feature set for both accelerometer and EMG, 60 isolated Greek Sign Language signs were recognized with an accuracy of 93% (Kosmidou and Hadjileontiadis, 2009). The combination of the MYO armband and Leap Motion camera was used to estimate continuous hand position (Quivira et al., 2018). Combining deep learning with principal component analysis (PCA), the grasp of a prosthetic hand was controlled (Li et al., 2018).\\n\\nSign languages are not exactly expressed with hands. It is also critical to catch facial expressions. For example, raising eyebrows means an open-ended question in ASL (Bragg et al., 2019). In video-based translation, it is easy to catch the movements of hands and face with a camera simultaneously. However, a few studies have considered facial expressions as important information. For wearable sensors, facial EMG data are widely used in emotional classification. Five different facial emotions were classified with 2-channel EMG sensors and a CNN classifier (Kehri and Awale, 2020). Emotion recognition with EMG measurements of the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscles was studied to identify happy, angry, and neutral faces (Kulke et al., 2020). In naturalistic studies, facial EMG signals can also be used to assess subjective emotional valence. Wearable devices with EMG electrodes were developed to record participants\' facial changes while viewing emotional films (Sato et al., 2021). With the evaluation of facial EMG, emotional facial expressions in real-life social interactions were more evocative of reactions than experimental conditions (Hsu et al., 2020).\\n\\nIn summary, with deep learning models, both vision-based and wearable sensor-based methods can translate human movements into text sentences during sign language performance. The vision-based works tend to build and train the model on benchmarks with advanced algorithms and data augmentation. Wearable sensor-based topics always collect data by themselves due to different kinds of devices applied in experiments. With only EMG signals from forearms, limited sign language words or sentences can be recognized accurately. After adding the data from inertial measurement units (IMU), results are significantly improved (Zhang et al., 2019).\\n\\nIn our work, we have applied IMU signals from forearms and hands to translate 40 ASL sentences into texts following the grammar rules. To realize end-to-end translation, two kinds of encoder-decoder structured models in NLP are included: the LSTM-based model and transformer-based model. To acquire more information, facial expression data collected by EMG sensors are also regarded as a part of the input to translation models. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first collected IMU and EMG signals and did signal preprocessing. Then we presented LSTM and transformer models and trained the models with the dataset. The models were evaluated by the testing dataset, and the significance of the EMG signal was discussed. Finally, the discussion and conclusion of the paper were drawn.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\nASL Specifics\\n\\nAmerican sign language is a kind of visual language expressed via a sequence of sign gestures. A sign consists of four main components, i.e., hand shape, movement, palm orientation, and location. In addition, facial expression can also be critical to express the signer\'s current mood. For example, raised eyebrow always indicates asking a question and a neutral face conveys a statement of fact. In addition to neutrality and questioning, positive and negative emotions are also considered in this research. In total, 40 commonly used sentences (listed in Table 1) with emotions positive, negative, questioning, and neutral were selected for recognition. These 40 sentences come from popular sign language videos on the Internet. The signers perform these sentences with obvious facial expressions.\\n\\nTABLE 1\\n\\nTable 1. Forty commonly used American sign language sentences.\\n\\nDataset Collection\\n\\nThe movements of forearms and hands were obtained by the Perception Neuron Motion Capture System. As shown in Figure 1A, this system is based on wearable IMU sensors named “Neuron.” Each Neuron is composed of an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. There are 25 Neurons for capturing upper body movements. The motion capture system needs to communicate with the Axis Neuron software. Axis Neuron can receive and process the data from all IMU sensors and export it into a .bvh format file. In this file, skeleton information and movement information of the whole process are recorded. We have only used the motion data, which record the rotation information of all joints of the human body. We have only focused on the data from hands and forearms\' joints. The sampling rate was 60 Hz.\\n\\nFIGURE 1\\n\\nFigure 1.

Figure 1B shows a 2-channel EMG signal acquisition system. The system mainly includes an NI data collector and differential electrodes. The NI USB-6008 provides eight single-ended analog inputs. Four single-ended analog inputs were used to form two differential channels. Another grounded channel was used as a reference. The electrode applied in this system was wet silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) surface electrode. The useful information of EMG signals was mainly distributed in the frequency range of 0–500 Hz (De Luca et al., 2010). To meet the Nyquist sampling theorem, the sampling rate was chosen as 1 kHz.\\n\\nIn the experiment, EMG signals from zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii areas and ", \'embedding\': None}', metadata={'score': 0.8805510997772217, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:5323'}), RetrieverResultItem(content="{'id': ':0', 'index': 0, 'text': 'Sign Language Translator enables the hearing impaired user to communicate efficiently in sign language, and the application will translate the same into text/speech.

Answer: To build a Sign Language translation system with a diverse and usable dataset, consider the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Use a combination of vision-based and wearable sensor-based methods to capture a wide range of sign language gestures. For vision-based methods, employ cameras to record hand and facial movements. For wearable sensor-based methods, use devices like data gloves, wristwatches, or armbands equipped with inertial sensors and surface electromyography (EMG) sensors.
   - Collect data from a diverse group of signers to ensure variability in signing styles and expressions. Include different age groups, genders, and ethnic backgrounds.

2. **Dataset Composition**:
   - Ensure the dataset includes a variety of sign language components such as hand shapes, movements, palm orientations, and locations. Also, capture facial expressions, as they are critical for conveying emotions and questions in sign language.
   - Include commonly used sentences and phrases, as well as isolated signs, to cover a broad spectrum of communication scenarios.

3. **Annotation and Tagging**:
   - Annotate the collected data with detailed labels, including the sign being performed, the corresponding text translation, and any associated emotions or questions indicated by facial expressions.
   - Use a standardized format for annotations to facilitate easy integration with machine learning models.

4. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the dataset. This can include variations in lighting, background, and signer positioning for vision-based data, and noise addition or signal transformation for sensor-based data.

5. **Validation and Testing**:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets to ensure the model can generalize well to unseen data.
   - Continuously evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and Sentence Error Rate (SER) to identify areas for improvement.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive and diverse dataset that can be used to train and test sign language translation systems effectively.

Answer: Globalization has significantly influenced the preferred writing style of readers by fostering a more diverse and interconnected literary landscape. As information and cultural products flow seamlessly across borders, readers are exposed to a wide array of narrative styles and voices from different cultures. This exposure has led to a preference for writing styles that are more direct and engaging, often characterized by a strong authorial or character voice and less reliance on extensive description.

Several aspects have contributed to this evolution in writing style:

1. **Cultural Exchange**: The globalization of information has facilitated the exchange of cultural narratives, allowing readers to experience stories from various parts of the world. This has broadened their tastes and expectations, leading to a preference for styles that are more immediate and relatable.

2. **Media Influence**: The evolution of media, including television and film, has influenced literary styles. Visual media often rely on strong character development and dialogue, which has translated into a preference for similar elements in literature.

3. **Attention Span**: In an age of information overload, readers may have shorter attention spans and prefer narratives that are concise and to the point. This has led to a reduction in lengthy descriptions in favor of more dynamic storytelling.

4. **Character Voice**: The popularity of character-driven narratives, where the story is told through the perspective of a distinct voice, has increased. This style allows for a more intimate connection with the reader and reflects the diverse voices that globalization has brought to the forefront.

Overall, globalization has encouraged a shift towards writing styles that are more varied, engaging, and reflective of a globalized world, where readers seek stories that resonate with their diverse experiences and perspectives.

Answer: A COVID infection can relate to anxiety and depression in previously healthy individuals in several ways. Severe COVID-19 can be devastating, leading to organ damage and persistent symptoms, which can result in loss of physical, emotional, and economic well-being. This can leave individuals feeling depressed and anxious. Additionally, treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) is a risk factor for developing anxiety and depression, as post-intensive care syndrome can affect people who have been treated in an ICU. The long-term effects of COVID-19 and its treatment can contribute to these mental health issues.

Answer: Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings, including emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). People with bipolar disorder experience mood episodes that are distinct from their usual moods and behaviors, lasting for most of the day, every day, for extended periods. These episodes can significantly impact sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior, and the ability to think clearly.

There are several types of bipolar disorder, including Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Cyclothymic disorder, each with varying patterns of manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes. Bipolar I involves at least one manic episode, while Bipolar II involves at least one major depressive episode and one hypomanic episode, without any full manic episodes. Cyclothymic disorder involves periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are less severe than those in major depression.

Diagnosis of bipolar disorder involves a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare provider, including a physical exam, mental health evaluation, and consideration of the individual's symptoms, lifetime history, and family history. Treatment typically involves medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to manage mood swings and other symptoms.

Bipolar disorder can co-occur with other mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders, ADHD, substance misuse, or eating disorders. It can also involve psychotic symptoms during severe mood episodes. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for managing the condition and improving quality of life.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Theoretical engine

Axial cross section of Carnot's heat engine. In this diagram, abcd is a cylindrical vessel, cd is a movable piston, and A and B are constant–temperature bodies. The vessel may be placed in contact with either body or removed from both (as it is here).

A Carnot heat engine is a heat engine that operates on the Carnot cycle. The basic model for this engine was developed by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 and mathematically explored by Rudolf Clausius in 1857, work that led to the fundamental thermodynamic concept of entropy. The Carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine which is theoretically possible. The efficiency depends only upon the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs between which it operates.

A heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and, in the process, converting some of that energy to mechanical work. The cycle may also be reversed. The system may be worked upon by an external force, and in the process, it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one, thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine.

Every thermodynamic system exists in a particular state. A thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states, and finally returned to its initial state. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a heat engine.

Carnot's diagram [ edit ]

In the adjacent diagram, from Carnot's 1824 work, Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, there are "two bodies A and B, kept each at a constant temperature, that of A being higher than that of B. These two bodies to which we can give, or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric. We will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator.” Carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power, i.e., “work”, by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body A to body B. It also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a refrigerator.

Modern diagram [ edit ]

Carnot engine diagram (modern) - where an amount of heat Q H flows from a high temperature T H furnace through the fluid of the "working body" (working substance) and the remaining heat Q C flows into the cold sink T C , thus forcing the working substance to do mechanical work W on the surroundings, via cycles of contractions and expansions.

The previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by Carnot in discussing his ideal engine. The figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine, such as the Carnot engine. In the diagram, the “working body” (system), a term introduced by Clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat Q can be introduced or transmitted to produce work. Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion, such as vapor of water, vapor of alcohol, vapor of mercury, a permanent gas, air, etc. Although in those early years, engines came in a number of configurations, typically Q H was supplied by a boiler, wherein water was boiled over a furnace; Q C was typically removed by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine. The output work, W, is transmitted by the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm, which in turn was typically used to power a pulley so as to lift water out of flooded salt mines. Carnot defined work as “weight lifted through a height”.





Carnot cycle [ edit ]

Figure 1: A Carnot cycle illustrated on a PV diagram to illustrate the work done.

Figure 2: A Carnot cycle acting as a heat engine, illustrated on a temperature-entropy diagram. The cycle takes place between a hot reservoir at temperature T H and a cold reservoir at temperature T C . The vertical axis is temperature, the horizontal axis is entropy.

The Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:

Reversible isothermal expansion of the gas at the "hot" temperature, T H (isothermal heat addition or absorption). During this step (A to B) the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings. The temperature of the gas (the system) does not change during the process, and thus the expansion is isothermic. The gas expansion is propelled by absorption of heat energy Q H and of entropy Δ S H = Q H / T H \Delta S_{\text{H}}=Q_{\text{H}}/T_{\text{H}} Isentropic (reversible adiabatic) expansion of the gas (isentropic work output). For this step (B to C) the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated, thus they neither gain nor lose heat. The gas continues to expand, doing work on the surroundings, and losing an equivalent amount of internal energy. The gas expansion causes it to cool to the "cold" temperature, T C . The entropy remains unchanged. Reversible isothermal compression of the gas at the "cold" temperature, T C . (isothermal heat rejection) (C to D) Now the gas is exposed to the cold temperature reservoir while the surroundings do work on the gas by compressing it (such as through the return compression of a piston), while causing an amount of waste heat Q C < 0 (with the standard sign convention for heat) and of entropy Δ S C = Q C / T C < 0 {\displaystyle \Delta S_{\text{C}}=Q_{\text{C}}/T_{\text{C}}<0} Isentropic compression of the gas (isentropic work input). (D to A) Once again the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated and the cold temperature reservoir is removed. During this step, the surroundings continue to do work to further compress the gas and both the temperature and pressure rise now that the heat sink has been removed. This additional work increases the internal energy of the gas, compressing it and causing the temperature to rise to T H . The entropy remains unchanged. At this point the gas is in the same state as at the start of step 1.

Carnot's theorem [ edit ]

Real ideal engines (left) compared to the Carnot cycle (right). The entropy of a real material changes with temperature. This change is indicated by the curve on a T–S diagram. For this figure, the curve indicates a vapor-liquid equilibrium (See Rankine cycle). Irreversible systems and losses of heat (for example, due to friction) prevent the ideal from taking place at every step.

Carnot's theorem is a formal statement of this fact: No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.

η I = W Q H = 1 − T C T H {\displaystyle \eta _{I}={\frac {W}{Q_{\mathrm {H} }}}=1-{\frac {T_{\mathrm {C} }}{T_{\mathrm {H} }}}}

Explanation

This maximum efficiency η I \eta _{\text{I}} is defined as above:

W is the work done by the system (energy exiting the system as work), Q H Q_{\text{H}} T C T_{\text{C}} absolute temperature of the cold reservoir, and T H T_{\text{H}} absolute temperature of the hot reservoir.

A corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient.

It is easily shown that the efficiency η is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a reversible process. This means the total entropy of system and surroundings (the entropies of the hot furnace, the "working fluid" of the heat engine, and the cold sink) remains constant when the "working fluid" completes one cycle and returns to its original state. (In the general and more realistic case of an irreversible process, the total entropy of this combined system would increase.)

Since the "working fluid" comes back to the same state after one cycle, and entropy of the system is a state function, the change in entropy of the "working fluid" system is 0. Thus, it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero, for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum. This derivation is carried out in the next section.

The coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency.

Efficiency of real heat engines [ edit ]

For a real heat engine, the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible. The working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle, and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is 0, but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than 0.

The internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable, so its total change in one cycle is 0. So the total work done by the system W is equal to the net heat put into the system, the sum of Q H Q_{\text{H}} > 0 taken up and the waste heat Q C Q_{\text{C}} < 0 given off:

W = Q = Q H + Q C {\displaystyle W=Q=Q_{\text{H}}+Q_{\text{C}}} (2)

For real engines, stages 1 and 3 of the Carnot cycle, in which heat is absorbed by the "working fluid" from the hot reservoir, and released by it to the cold reservoir, respectively, no longer remain ideally reversible, and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place.

During heat transfer from the hot reservoir at T H T_{\text{H}} to the fluid, the fluid would have a slightly lower temperature than T H T_{\text{H}} , and the process for the fluid may not necessarily remain isothermal. Let Δ S H \Delta S_{\text{H}} be the total entropy change of the fluid in the process of intake of heat.

Δ S H = ∫ Q in d Q H T {\displaystyle \Delta S_{\text{H}}=\int _{Q_{\text{in}}}{\frac {{\text{d}}Q_{\text{H}}}{T}}} (3)

where the temperature of the fluid T is always slightly lesser than T H T_{\text{H}} , in this process.

So, one would get:

Q H T H = ∫ d Q H T H ≤ Δ S H {\displaystyle {\frac {Q_{\text{H}}}{T_{\text{H}}}}={\frac {\int {\text{d}}Q_{\text{H}}}{T_{\text{H}}}}\leq \Delta S_{\text{H}}} (4)

Similarly, at the time of heat injection from the fluid to the cold reservoir one would have, for the magnitude of total entropy change Δ S C \Delta S_{\text{C}} < 0 of the fluid in the process of expelling heat:

Δ S C ⩾ Q C T C < 0 {\displaystyle \Delta S_{\text{C}}\geqslant {\frac {Q_{\text{C}}}{T_{\text{C}}}}<0} (5)

where, during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir, the temperature of the fluid T is always slightly greater than T C T_{\text{C}} .

We have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here. Since the total change of entropy of the fluid system for the cyclic process is 0, we must have

Δ S H + Δ S C = Δ S cycle = 0 {\displaystyle \Delta S_{\text{H}}+\Delta S_{\text{C}}=\Delta S_{\text{cycle}}=0} (6)

The previous three equations combine to give:

− Q C T C ⩾ Q H T H {\displaystyle -{\frac {Q_{\text{C}}}{T_{\text{C}}}}\geqslant {\frac {Q_{\text{H}}}{T_{\text{H}}}}} (7)

Equations (2) and (7) combine to give

W Q H ≤ 1 − T C T H {\displaystyle {\frac {W}{Q_{\text{H}}}}\leq 1-{\frac {T_{\text{C}}}{T_{\text{H}}}}} (8)

Hence,

η ≤ η I {\displaystyle \eta \leq \eta _{\text{I}}} (9)

where η = W Q H \eta ={\frac {W}{Q_{\text{H}}}} is the efficiency of the real engine, and η I \eta _{\text{I}} is the efficiency of the Carnot engine working between the same two reservoirs at the temperatures T H T_{\text{H}} and T C T_{\text{C}} . For the Carnot engine, the entire process is 'reversible', and Equation (7) is an equality. Hence, the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal Carnot engine.

Equation (7) signifies that the total entropy of system and surroundings (the fluid and the two reservoirs) increases for the real engine, because (in a surroundings-based analysis) the entropy gain of the cold reservoir as Q C Q_{\text{C}} flows into it at the fixed temperature T C T_{\text{C}} , is greater than the entropy loss of the hot reservoir as Q H Q_{\text{H}} leaves it at its fixed temperature T H T_{\text{H}} . The inequality in Equation (7) is essentially the statement of the Clausius theorem.

According to the second theorem, "The efficiency of the Carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance".

The Carnot engine and Rudolf Diesel [ edit ]

In 1892 Rudolf Diesel patented an internal combustion engine inspired by the Carnot engine. Diesel knew a Carnot engine is an ideal that cannot be built, but he thought he had invented a working approximation. His principle was unsound, but in his struggle to implement it he developed the practical engine that bears his name.

The conceptual problem was how to achieve isothermal expansion in an internal combustion engine, since burning fuel at the highest temperature of the cycle would only raise the temperature further. Diesel's patented solution was: having achieved the highest temperature just by compressing the air, to add a small amount of fuel at a controlled rate, such that heating caused by burning the fuel would be counteracted by cooling caused by air expansion as the piston moved. Hence all the heat from the fuel would be transformed into work during the isothermal expansion, as required by Carnot's theorem.

For the idea to work a small mass of fuel would have to be burnt in a huge mass of air. Diesel first proposed a working engine that would compress air to 250 atmospheres at 800 °C, then cycle to one atmosphere at 20 °C. However, this was well beyond the technological capabilities of the day, since it implied a compression ratio of 60:1. Such an engine, could it have been built, would have had an efficiency of 73%. (In contrast, the best steam engines of his day achieved 7%.)

Accordingly, Diesel sought to compromise. He calculated that, were he to reduce the peak pressure to a less ambitious 90 atmospheres, he would sacrifice only 5% of the thermal efficiency. Seeking financial support, he published the "Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Engine to Take the Place of the Steam Engine and All Presently Known Combustion Engines" (1893). Endorsed by scientific opinion, including Lord Kelvin, he won the backing of Krupp and Maschinenfabrik Augsburg. He clung to the Carnot cycle as a symbol. But years of practical work failed to achieve an isothermal combustion engine, nor could have done, since it requires such an enormous quantity of air that it cannot develop enough power to compress it. Furthermore, controlled fuel injection turned out to be no easy matter.

Even so, it slowly evolved over 25 years to become a practical high-compression air engine, its fuel injected near the end of the compression stroke and ignited by the heat of compression, in a word, the diesel engine. Today its efficiency is 40%.

Answer: A Carnot engine is a theoretical heat engine that operates on the Carnot cycle, which was developed by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. It is considered the most efficient heat engine possible, with its efficiency depending only on the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs between which it operates. The Carnot engine transfers energy from a warm region to a cool region of space, converting some of that energy into mechanical work. The cycle can also be reversed, allowing the system to act as a refrigerator or heat pump. The Carnot engine's efficiency is described by Carnot's theorem, which states that no engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.

In this diagram, abcd is a cylindrical vessel, cd is a movable piston, and A and B are constant–temperature bodies. The vessel may be placed in contact with either body or removed from both (as it is here).\\n\\nA Carnot heat engine is a heat engine that operates on the Carnot cycle. The basic model for this engine was developed by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 and mathematically explored by Rudolf Clausius in 1857, work that led to the fundamental thermodynamic concept of entropy. The Carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine which is theoretically possible. The efficiency depends only upon the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs between which it operates.\\n\\nA heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and, in the process, converting some of that energy to mechanical work. The cycle may also be reversed. The system may be worked upon by an external force, and in the process, it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one, thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine.\\n\\nEvery thermodynamic system exists in a particular state. A thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states, and finally returned to its initial state. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a heat engine.\\n\\nCarnot\\\'s diagram [ edit ]\\n\\nIn the adjacent diagram, from Carnot\\\'s 1824 work, Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, there are "two bodies A and B, kept each at a constant temperature, that of A being higher than that of B. These two bodies to which we can give, or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric. We will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator.” Carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power, i.e., “work”, by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body A to body B. It also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a refrigerator.\\n\\nModern diagram [ edit ]\\n\\nCarnot engine diagram (modern) - where an amount of heat Q H flows from a high temperature T H furnace through the fluid of the "working body" (working substance) and the remaining heat Q C flows into the cold sink T C , thus forcing the working substance to do mechanical work W on the surroundings, via cycles of contractions and expansions.\\n\\nThe previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by Carnot in discussing his ideal engine. The figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine, such as the Carnot engine. In the diagram, the “working body” (system), a term introduced by Clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat Q can be introduced or transmitted to produce work. Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion, such as vapor of water, vapor of alcohol, vapor of mercury, a permanent gas, air, etc. Although in those early years, engines came in a number of configurations, typically Q H was supplied by a boiler, wherein water was boiled over a furnace; Q C was typically removed by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine. The output work, W, is transmitted by the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm, which in turn was typically used to power a pulley so as to lift water out of flooded salt mines. Carnot defined work as “weight lifted through a height”.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarnot cycle [ edit ]\\n\\nFigure 1: A Carnot cycle illustrated on a PV diagram to illustrate the work done.\\n\\nFigure 2: A Carnot cycle acting as a heat engine, illustrated on a temperature-entropy diagram. The cycle takes place between a hot reservoir at temperature T H and a cold reservoir at temperature T C . The vertical axis is temperature, the horizontal axis is entropy.\\n\\nThe Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:\\n\\nReversible isothermal expansion of the gas at the "hot" temperature, T H (isothermal heat addition or absorption). During this step (A to B) the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings. The temperature of the gas (the system) does not change during the process, and thus the expansion is isothermic. The gas expansion is propelled by absorption of heat energy Q H and of entropy Δ S H = Q H / T H \\\\Delta S_{\\\\text{H}}=Q_{\\\\text{H}}/T_{\\\\text{H}} Isentropic (reversible adiabatic) expansion of the gas (isentropic work output). For this step (B to C) the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated, thus they neither gain nor lose heat. The gas continues to expand, doing work on the surroundings, and losing an equivalent amount of internal energy. The gas expansion causes it to cool to the "cold" temperature, T C . The entropy remains unchanged. Reversible isothermal compression of the gas at the "cold" temperature, T C . (isothermal heat rejection) (C to D) Now the gas is exposed to the cold temperature reservoir while the surroundings do work on the gas by compressing it (such as through the return compression of a piston), while causing an amount of waste heat Q C < 0 (with the standard sign convention for heat) and of entropy Δ S C = Q C / T C < 0 {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta S_{\\\\text{C}}=Q_{\\\\text{C}}/T_{\\\\text{C}}<0} Isentropic compression of the gas (isentropic work input). (D to A) Once again the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated and the cold temperature reservoir is removed. During this step, the surroundings continue to do work to further compress the gas and both the temperature and pressure rise now that the heat sink has been removed. This additional work increases the internal energy of the gas, compressing it and causing the temperature to rise to T H . The entropy remains unchanged. At this point the gas is in the same state as at the start of step 1.\\n\\nCarnot\\\'s theorem [ edit ]\\n\\nReal ideal engines (left) compared to the Carnot cycle (right). The entropy of a real material changes with temperature. This change is indicated by the curve on a T–S diagram. For this figure, the curve indicates a vapor-liquid equilibrium (See Rankine cycle). Irreversible systems and losses of heat (for example, due to friction) prevent the ideal from taking place at every step.\\n\\nCarnot\\\'s theorem is a formal statement of this fact: No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.\\n\\nη I = W Q H = 1 − T C T H {\\\\displaystyle \\\\eta _{I}={\\\\frac {W}{Q_{\\\\mathrm {H} }}}=1-{\\\\frac {T_{\\\\mathrm {C} }}{T_{\\\\mathrm {H} }}}}\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nThis maximum efficiency η I \\\\eta _{\\\\text{I}} is defined as above:\\n\\nW is the work done by the system (energy exiting the system as work), Q H Q_{\\\\text{H}} T C T_{\\\\text{C}} absolute temperature of the cold reservoir, and T H T_{\\\\text{H}} absolute temperature of the hot reservoir.\\n\\nA corollary to Carnot\\\'s theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient.\\n\\nIt is easily shown that the efficiency η is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a reversible process. This means the total entropy of system and surroundings (the entropies of the hot furnace, the "working fluid" of the heat engine, and the cold sink) remains constant when the "working fluid" completes one cycle and returns to its original state. (In the general and more realistic case of an irreversible process, the total entropy of this combined system would increase.)\\n\\nSince the "working fluid" comes back to the same state after one cycle, and entropy of the system is a state function, the change in entropy of the "working fluid" system is 0. Thus, it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero, for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum. This derivation is carried out in the next section.\\n\\nThe coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency.\\n\\nEfficiency of real heat engines [ edit ]\\n\\nFor a real heat engine, the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible. The working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle, and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is 0, but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than 0.\\n\\nThe internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable, so its total change in one cycle is 0. So the total work done by the system W is equal to the net heat put into the system, the sum of Q H Q_{\\\\text{H}} > 0 taken up and the waste heat Q C Q_{\\\\text{C}} < 0 given off:\\n\\nW = Q = Q H + Q C {\\\\displaystyle W=Q=Q_{\\\\text{H}}+Q_{\\\\text{C}}} (2)\\n\\nFor real engines, stages 1 and 3 of the Carnot cycle, in which heat is absorbed by the "working fluid" from the hot reservoir, and released by it to the cold reservoir, respectively, no longer remain ideally reversible, and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place.\\n\\nDuring heat transfer from the hot reservoir at T H T_{\\\\text{H}} to the fluid, the fluid would have a slightly lower temperature than T H T_{\\\\text{H}} , and the process for the fluid may not necessarily remain isothermal. Let Δ S H \\\\Delta S_{\\\\text{H}} be the total entropy change of the fluid in the process of intake of heat.\\n\\nΔ S H = ∫ Q in d Q H T {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta S_{\\\\text{H}}=\\\\int _{Q_{\\\\text{in}}}{\\\\frac {{\\\\text{d}}Q_{\\\\text{H}}}{T}}} (3)\\n\\nwhere the temperature of the fluid T is always slightly lesser than T H T_{\\\\text{H}} , in this process.\\n\\nSo, one would get:\\n\\nQ H T H = ∫ d Q H T H ≤ Δ S H {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {Q_{\\\\text{H}}}{T_{\\\\text{H}}}}={\\\\frac {\\\\int {\', \'embedding\': None}', metadata={'score': 0.8988354206085205, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:debe9591-a066-4c0f-8a46-30e6de128087:5501'}), RetrieverResultItem(content='{\'id\': \':1\', \'index\': 1, \'text\': \'\\\\text{d}}Q_{\\\\text{H}}}{T_{\\\\text{H}}}}\\\\leq \\\\Delta S_{\\\\text{H}}} (4)\\n\\nSimilarly, at the time of heat injection from the fluid to the cold reservoir one would have, for the magnitude of total entropy change Δ S C \\\\Delta S_{\\\\text{C}} < 0 of the fluid in the process of expelling heat:\\n\\nΔ S C ⩾ Q C T C < 0 {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta S_{\\\\text{C}}\\\\geqslant {\\\\frac {Q_{\\\\text{C}}}{T_{\\\\text{C}}}}<0} (5)\\n\\nwhere, during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir, the temperature of the fluid T is always slightly greater than T C T_{\\\\text{C}} .\\n\\nWe have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: The term “regulatory harmonization” can have different definitions depending on the context of its usage. One definition that is applicable to those efforts CBER is involved with is: the process by which technical guidelines are developed to be uniform across participating authorities. “Regulatory convergence,” on the other hand, represents a process whereby the regulatory requirements across countries or regions become more similar or “aligned” over time as a result of the gradual adoption of internationally recognized technical guidance documents, standards and scientific principles, common or similar practices and procedures, or adoption of regulatory mechanisms that might be specific to a local legal context but that align with shared principles to achieve a common public health goal. It does not necessarily represent the harmonization of laws and regulations, which is not a prerequisite for allowing the alignment of technical requirements and greater regulatory cooperation. The Agency engages in a range of explicit harmonization initiatives as well as convergence activities, a number of which include the participation of CBER.

CBER Harmonization Program Activities

Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Life Sciences Innovation Forum Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization is a multilateral, voluntary collective of economies that border the Pacific. APEC promotes trade and sustainable economic growth through policy alignment and technical cooperation. APEC undertakes its work through an array of dedicated subject matter fora, which includes the Life Sciences Innovation Forum (LSIF). The primary goal of the LSIF “is to bring together representatives of the government, private sector and academia to promote life-sciences innovation in support of human health in the region.” In 2008, the Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee (RHSC) was created under the authority of the LSIF in order to promote a strategic and coordinated approach to medical product regulatory harmonization/convergence and capacity building efforts within the APEC region. The RHSC has developed a Strategic Framework that identifies priority work areas and implementation roadmaps which promote greater convergence in the regulation of medical products, which includes training as an important component. FDA CBER joins the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health in participating in the RHSC and its working groups. FDA CBER experts contribute to the following priority work areas: Global Supply Chain Integrity and Product Quality, Pharmacovigilance, Good Registration Management, Multi-regional Clinical Trials and Good Clinical Practice Inspection, Advanced Therapies, Medical Devices, and Biotherapeutic Products.

International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)

ICH was, until recently, known as the International Conference for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. However, as of October 23, 2015, it became an Association under Swiss Law upon the finalization of the Articles of Association. With this change, ICH became the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. Also, ICH changed its governance structure, funding model, and opened its doors to new members to widen its global reach.

ICH stands as the seminal initiative in the domain of regulatory harmonization for medical products. The primary objective of ICH is to promote public health. The aim is to contribute to a more timely introduction of new medicines and continued availability of approved medicines to patients. For example, by minimizing the use of animal testing and preventing unnecessary duplication of clinical trials in humans, without compromising safety and effectiveness, as well as contributing to the development, registration and manufacturing of safe, effective and high quality medicines in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Moreover, it works to fulfill this goal through the development of harmonized guidelines through a process of scientific consensus by regulatory and industry experts. Furthermore, a key ingredient to the success of the ICH is the commitment by its regulatory members to implement its guidelines. Thus, finalized ICH guidelines are implemented in the U.S. as FDA guidances through its usual Federal Register publication process.



The International Pharmaceutical Regulators Programme (IPRP)

The International Pharmaceutical Regulators Programme (IPRP) was officially launched on 1 January 2018, following a decision of the governance bodies of the International Generic Drug Regulators Programme (IGDRP) and the International Pharmaceutical Regulators Forum (IPRF) in November 2017. The two initiatives had complementary objectives and a largely overlapping membership of regulatory authorities and organizations, but covered a different scope of products: IPRF focused on innovative pharmaceutical products and technologies, IGDRP focused on issues of interest relating to generic products. Both sides had agreed that by a consolidation of the two initiatives, efficiencies could be gained and synergies be created.

The IPRP strives to create an environment for its members and observers to exchange information on issues of mutual interest and enable cooperation among regulatory authorities and organizations, maximize synergies and avoid duplication of effort, create a regulatory hub for pharmaceuticals, and enable closer linkages with other initiatives to, again, maximize synergies and avoid duplication of effort.

The IPRP meetings are held in conjunction with those of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) in the interest of efficiency. The ICH Secretariat provides support services to IPRP through funding provided by a number of the IPRP members, including the FDA.

The former working groups of the IPRF and the IGDRP continue to operate. CBER experts are active in the Gene Therapies Working Group, the Cell Therapies Working Group, and the Identification of Medicinal Product Standards (IDMP) Working Group. CBER joins the Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research (CDER) as members of the IPRP MC.

A new website was created for the consolidated initiative under the domain name www.iprp.global where general information on the IPRP can be found as well as information and the work products of the various working groups.

Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization

The Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization (PANDRH) is an initiative of the National Regulatory Authorities of the region and the Pan American Health Organization that supports the processes of regulatory convergence/harmonization in the Americas, within the framework of national and sub-regional realities, needs, laws and policies related to health. The PANDRH comprises:

The Pan American Conference on Drug Regulatory Harmonization, the Steering Committee, the Advisory Council and the Technical Groups in as many areas as defined by the Conference and the Secretariat to be a priority. Its mission is to advance regulatory convergence in the arena of health products covering aspects of quality, safety, effectiveness and rational use of health products, and the strengthening of the capacities of the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in the region of the Americas, based on the needs of the population to have access to quality health products in accordance with the progress of science and technology within the context of national and sub-regional realities. CBER participates in partnership with other components of the Agency.

Talking about global harmonization implies that all regulatory agencies agree upon developing, implementing, and adopting the same guidelines and technical standards focused on quality, safety, and efficacy, that would be eventually applied by each Regulatory Agencies on the respective countries. Such harmonization may generate increased effectiveness and decreased costs for every country.

This is an extract taken from What is standing in the way of global harmonisation? Part II: Industry Voices. Click here to read the full article.

There are several global initiatives intended to drive harmonization and development, such as: Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), International Council for Harmonization (ICH), The International Pharmaceutical Regulators Programme (IPRP), Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization (PANDRH). However, their effort has not stood out as originally intended because there are different obstacles standing in the way of the global harmonization.

Which is the participation of the countries of America in those global initiatives?

It is worth to mention that many Regulatory Agencies in America are recognized by the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) as they comply with international standards, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, Health Canada, the Commission for Protection Against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS) in Mexico, the National Administration of Drugs, Food and Medical Technology (ANMAT) in Argentina, the National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance, Ministério da Saúde (ANVISA) in Brazil, the Institute of Public Health (ISP) in Chile, the National Institute for Drugs and Food Surveillance (INVIMA) in Colombia, and the Center for the State Control of Drug Quality, Public Health Ministry, in Cuba. Nevertheless, despite being recognized under international standards, if we compare their regulatory processes, they are far from being harmonized.

So, if harmonization initiatives exist, and the agencies look for a compliance under the same international standards and they have further adopted some guidelines in several countries, why this global harmonization has not occurred?

Several factors may be considered obstacles that represent a constraint for global harmonization. We consider the following as the most relevant:

Political changes – A change of Federal Government brings about modifications within Regulatory Agencies, most frequently the Head of such agencies. In most Latin American countries, directive positions within the National Regulatory Agencies have become political positions instead of being of technical-scientific nature. These changes impinge on the actions taken by the former Head as new actions are proposed. This causes the delay and sometimes the termination of any global harmonization activities previously planned.

Experience within the respective Agency – Several agencies do not have experts nor specialists in every subject. Thus, the introduction of new systems or technologies is frequently a time-consuming process, particularly in Latin American countries.

Thus, the introduction of new systems or technologies is frequently a time-consuming process, particularly in Latin American countries. Regional regulation – Each country possesses its regulatory framework and sometimes it is not updated according to the international guidelines because global harmonization is not contemplated by the political agenda of Presidents, Congresses, Senators, and Prime Ministers. This causes the stalling of transformation, innovation, and the capacity to improve public health.

This causes the stalling of transformation, innovation, and the capacity to improve public health. Collaboration among Agencies – In spite the collaborative work among Regulatory Agencies aimed towards harmonisation through different initiatives, they are frequently disrupted as a connection between them is not attained. Therefore, there is no collaboration excepting such initiative.

Therefore, there is no collaboration excepting such initiative. Insufficient resources – Several regulatory agencies face resource constraints of different nature such as human, financial, and infrastructure. This lack of resources within institutions causes activity saturation resulting in reduced operative capacity for essential processes. Thus, other activities or projects different from daily activities are left aside.

Thus, other activities or projects different from daily activities are left aside. Technology – Due to the aforementioned lack of resources, the implementation of new technologies is deficient within the Agencies. This generates a low availability of information for the interested parties. In turn, this also affects the prompt advancement towards regulatory, technological, and technical harmonization for some agencies.

In turn, this also affects the prompt advancement towards regulatory, technological, and technical harmonization for some agencies. Socioeconomic aspects – Another aspect that should be also considered regarding harmonization are the costs and fees established by each Agency to evaluate procedures and services. In many cases, this prompts the evaluation of unnecessary procedures causing an additional administrative load that prevents health professionals from developing and implementing optimal evaluation strategies aligned with international standards.

In many cases, this prompts the evaluation of unnecessary procedures causing an additional administrative load that prevents health professionals from developing and implementing optimal evaluation strategies aligned with international standards. National Identity – Frequently, the concept of national identity may be an obstacle for global harmonization as the acceptance of directives different from the internal initiative of the country it is often thought as an infringement or violation of the nationalist thinking. This has been caused by the lack of bilateral agreements that would allow a mutual acknowledgment.

In order to attain a harmonization, we consider that it is essential the involvement of several figures participating in all health-related processes, such as the pharmaceutical industry, Universities/Academia, and the authorities. In this way, it is possible to migrate towards a confidence-based framework with scientific value and the delegation of responsibilities among all the involved parties. Consequently, the agencies may carry out collaborative work with other counties based on technical, scientific, and regulatory aspects allowing the establishment of a global framework that is possible and feasible for all probable scenarios.

Finally, the questions we should be asking ourselves in this regard are why is necessary a global harmonization? and which are the advantages for each one of the countries involved? If we wish to answer these questions, an analysis must be performed considering the needs and conditions of each country. Additionally, it is necessary to raise interest and to drive the willingness to establish directives towards a global harmonization and to continually support this kind of initiatives.

Answer: Regulatory harmonization is a process aimed at developing uniform technical guidelines across participating authorities. It is intended to increase effectiveness and decrease costs by aligning regulatory standards focused on quality, safety, and efficacy. However, achieving global harmonization faces several obstacles, such as political changes, lack of expertise, regional regulatory differences, insufficient resources, and socioeconomic factors. Despite these challenges, harmonization initiatives like APEC, ICH, IPRP, and PANDRH strive to align regulatory practices across regions. The involvement of various stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and authorities, is crucial to advancing harmonization efforts. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a global framework that benefits public health by ensuring the availability of safe and effective medicines.

One definition that is applicable to those efforts CBER is involved with is: the process by which technical guidelines are developed to be uniform across participating authorities. “Regulatory convergence,” on the other hand, represents a process whereby the regulatory requirements across countries or regions become more similar or “aligned” over time as a result of the gradual adoption of internationally recognized technical guidance documents, standards and scientific principles, common or similar practices and procedures, or adoption of regulatory mechanisms that might be specific to a local legal context but that align with shared principles to achieve a common public health goal. It does not necessarily represent the harmonization of laws and regulations, which is not a prerequisite for allowing the alignment of technical requirements and greater regulatory cooperation.

Answer: Determining the presence of practicing "Celtic" pagans in Ireland post-conversion would be challenging given that all surviving medieval Irish texts were copied by Christians. However, some potential indicators could include:

1. **Syncretism in Texts**: Look for elements of syncretism in the texts, where Christian and pagan elements are blended. This could suggest that pagan practices or beliefs were still influential or practiced alongside Christianity.

2. **References to Pagan Practices**: Examine the texts for references to pagan practices, rituals, or deities. Even if these references are framed negatively or as part of a Christian moral lesson, they might indicate the persistence of pagan traditions.

3. **Cultural Continuity**: Analyze the continuity of cultural practices, festivals, or customs that have pagan origins but were adapted into Christian contexts. This could suggest that the underlying pagan practices continued in some form.

4. **Archaeological Evidence**: Complement literary analysis with archaeological evidence that might indicate the continuation of pagan practices, such as the presence of pagan symbols or artifacts in post-conversion contexts.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the Irish texts with those from other regions that underwent similar conversions to identify patterns or unique elements that might suggest the persistence of pagan practices.

Ultimately, while the texts themselves were copied by Christians, careful analysis of their content, context, and the broader cultural and archaeological evidence might provide clues about the persistence of pagan practices in post-conversion Ireland.

Answer: Determining the presence of practicing "Celtic" pagans in Ireland post-conversion can be challenging due to the nature of the surviving historical and literary evidence, which was largely preserved by Christian scribes. However, several approaches can be taken to infer the persistence of pagan practices:

1. **Analysis of Syncretism**: Look for evidence of syncretism in the texts, where Christian and pagan elements are blended. This can indicate that pagan beliefs and practices were still influential during the time the texts were written.

2. **Folklore and Oral Traditions**: Examine folklore and oral traditions that may have been recorded later but have roots in earlier pagan practices. These can provide insights into beliefs and customs that persisted outside of the official Christian narrative.

3. **Archaeological Evidence**: Investigate archaeological findings that may suggest the continuation of pagan rituals or the use of sites traditionally associated with pre-Christian worship.

4. **Critical Textual Analysis**: Conduct a critical analysis of the texts to identify any underlying pagan themes or motifs that may have been retained, even if their original religious significance was altered or obscured by Christian scribes.

5. **Comparative Studies**: Compare Irish texts with those from other Celtic regions that may have experienced similar transitions, to identify common patterns or elements that suggest the persistence of pagan practices.

By using these methods, researchers can piece together a more comprehensive picture of the religious landscape in post-conversion Ireland, despite the Christian lens through which the surviving texts were filtered.

Furthermore, remote sensing exceedingly influences everyday life, ranging from weather forecasts to reports on climate change or natural disasters. As an example, 80% of the German students use the services of Google Earth; in 2006 alone the software was downloaded 100 million times. But studies have shown that only a fraction of them know more about the data they are working with.[43] There exists a huge knowledge gap between the application and the understanding of satellite images. Remote sensing only plays a tangential role in schools, regardless of the political claims to strengthen the support for teaching on the subject.[44] A lot of the computer software explicitly developed for school lessons has not yet been implemented due to its complexity. Thereby, the subject is either not at all integrated into the curriculum or does not pass the step of an interpretation of analogue images. In fact, the subject of remote sensing requires a consolidation of physics and mathematics as well as competences in the fields of media and methods apart from the mere visual interpretation of satellite images.\\n\\nMany teachers have great interest in the subject "remote sensing", being motivated to integrate this topic into teaching, provided that the curriculum is considered. In many cases, this encouragement fails because of confusing information.[45] In order to integrate remote sensing in a sustainable manner organizations like the EGU or Digital Earth[46] encourage the development of learning modules and learning portals.
