Context:  Automatic SOS — If Equipped Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle’s airbags deploy.  Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.
 SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle’s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle’s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle’s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle’s operable network and GPS antennas.

GraphRAG Score: 4Question: What may cause erratic or noisy performance of the radio?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Under certain conditions, the mobile phone being on in your vehicle can cause erratic or noisy performance from your radio.  This condition may be lessened or eliminated by repositioning the mobile phone within the vehicle.  This condition is not harmful to the radio.  If your radio performance does not satisfactorily improve from repositioning the mobile phone, it is recommended that the volume be turned down or off during mobile phone operation when not using the Uconnect system.  Jamming due to electronic devices or driving next to facilities emitting the same radio frequencies as the TPMS sensors.  Installing some form of aftermarket window tinting that affects radio wave signals.  Lots of snow or ice around the wheels or wheel housings.  Using tire chains on the vehicle.  Using wheels/tires not equipped with TPMS sensors.  The radio unit is acting as the amplifier for audio output from the Auxiliary device.  Therefore, if the volume control on the Auxiliary device is set too low, there will be insufficient audio signal for the radio unit to play the music on the device.

The entire weight of the trailer, including all cargo, consumables, and equipment (both permanent and temporary) loaded in or on the trailer in its "loaded and ready for operation" condition, must be supported by the scale. This measurement will give you the GTW.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  The cartridge block heater clips into the engine block near the water jacket and transfers heat to the coolant.  It requires a 110–115 Volt AC electrical outlet with a grounded, three-wire extension cord.  Its use is recommended for environments that routinely fall below -10°F (-23°C).  It should be used when the vehicle has not been running overnight or longer periods and should be plugged in two hours prior to start.  Its use is required for cold starts with temperatures under -20°F (-28°C).  To ensure reliable starting at these temperatures, use of an externally powered electric engine block heater (available from an authorized dealer) is recommended.  The engine block heater and heater cord are factory installed options.  If your vehicle is not equipped, engine block heaters and heater cords are available from an authorized Mopar® dealer.  Do not exceed the maximum power of 160 W (13 A) at 12 Volts.  If the 160 W (13 A) power rating is exceeded, the fuse protecting the system will need to be replaced.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not insert any other object in the power outlets as this will damage the outlet and blow the fuse.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage not covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Many accessories that can be plugged in draw power from the vehicle's battery, even when not in use (i.e., cellular phones, etc.).  Eventually, if plugged in long enough, the vehicle's battery will discharge sufficiently to degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from starting.  Accessories that draw higher power (i.e., coolers, vacuum cleaners, lights, etc.  ), will degrade the battery even more quickly.  Only use these intermittently and with greater caution.  After the use of high power draw accessories, or long periods of the vehicle not being started (with accessories still plugged in), the vehicle must be driven a sufficient length of time to allow the alternator to recharge the vehicle's battery.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not hang any type of accessory or accessory bracket from the plug.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage Turn off the Fuel Filter Heater, Turn off the HVAC Blower Motor, Close the HVAC Circulation Door Cut off battery power to the: Engine Electric Motor (if equipped) Electric power steering Brake booster Electric park brake Automatic transmission gear selector Horn Front wiper
 Extreme Cold Weather The cartridge block heater clips into the engine block near the water jacket and transfers heat to the coolant.  It requires a 110–115 Volt AC electrical outlet with a grounded, three-wire extension cord.  Its use is recommended for environments that routinely fall below -10°F (-23°C).  It should be used when the vehicle has not been running overnight or longer periods and should be plugged in two hours prior to start.  Its use is required for cold starts with temperatures under -20°F (-28°C).  A 12 Volt heater built into the fuel filter housing aids in preventing fuel gelling.  It is controlled by a built-in thermostat.  A Diesel Pre-Heat system both improves engine starting and reduces the amount of white smoke generated by a warming engine.  Note: The engine block heater and heater cord are factory installed options.  If your vehicle is not equipped, engine block heaters and heater cords are available from an authorized Mopar® dealer.

The doors may unlock when water is sprayed on the Passive Entry door handles if the key fob is located outside of the vehicle within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the handle.  If the vehicle is unlocked by Passive Entry and no door is opened within 60 seconds, the vehicle will relock and, if equipped, will arm the Vehicle Security system.  Frequency Operated Button Integrated Key (FOBIK-Safe) To minimize the possibility of unintentionally locking a Passive Entry key fob inside your vehicle, the Passive Entry system is equipped with an automatic door unlock feature which will function only if the ignition switch is in the OFF position.  FOBIK-Safe only executes in vehicles with Passive Entry.  There are three situations that trigger a FOBIK-Safe search in any Passive Entry vehicle: A lock request is made by a valid Passive Entry key fob while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the Passive Entry door handle while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the door panel switch while the door is open.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  Note: The vehicle will only unlock the doors during a FOBIK-Safe operation when a valid Passive Entry key fob is detected inside the vehicle.  The vehicle will not unlock the doors when any of the following conditions are true: A second valid Passive Entry key fob is detected outside of the vehicle (within 5 ft (1.5 m) of a Passive Entry door handle).  The doors are manually locked using the door lock knobs.  Three attempts are made to lock the doors using the door panel switch, and then the doors are closed.  To Lock The Vehicle’s Doors With one of the vehicle’s Passive Entry key fobs within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the driver or passenger front door handles, pushing the Passive Entry lock button will lock the vehicle doors.  Note: When pushing the door handle lock button, DO NOT grab the door handle.  This could unlock the door(s).  Note: After pushing the door handle button, the driver must wait three seconds before locking or unlocking the doors, using any Passive Entry door handle.  This is done to allow the driver to check if the vehicle is locked by pulling the door handle without the vehicle unlocking.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in “Preventing Inadvertent Locking Of Passive Entry Key Fob In Vehicle” remains active/functional.

 Your vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated Onboard Diagnostic system called OBD II.  This system monitors the performance of the emissions, engine, and transmission control systems.  When these systems are operating properly, your vehicle will provide excellent performance and fuel economy, as well as engine emissions well within current government regulations.  The Engine Check/Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is a part of an Onboard Diagnostic System called OBD II that monitors engine and automatic transmission control systems.  This warning light will illuminate when the ignition is in the ON/RUN position before engine start.  If the bulb does not come on when turning the ignition switch from OFF to ON/RUN, have the condition checked promptly.  Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  If you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  JUMP STARTING If your vehicle has a discharged battery, it can be jump started using a set of jumper cables and a battery in another vehicle, or by using a portable battery booster pack.  Jump starting can be dangerous if done improperly, so please follow the procedures in this section carefully.  WARNING: Do not attempt jump starting if the battery is frozen.  It could rupture or explode and cause personal injury.  CAUTION: Do not use a portable battery booster pack or any other booster source with a system voltage greater than 12 Volts or damage to the battery, starter motor, alternator or electrical system may occur.  Note: When using a portable battery booster pack, follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and precautions.  Preparations For Jump Start The battery in your vehicle is located in the right rear of the engine compartment.  If your vehicle is equipped with a Stop/Start system, it will be equipped with two batteries See the following steps to prepare for jump starting: Apply the parking brake, shift the automatic transmission into PARK (P) (manual transmission in NEUTRAL) and place the ignition in OFF mode.  Turn off the heater, radio, and all electrical accessories.  If using another vehicle to jump start the battery, park the vehicle within the jumper cable’s reach, apply the parking brake and make sure the ignition is OFF.  WARNING: Only use the positive battery post on the main battery to jump start your vehicle.  Serious injury or death could result if you attempt to jump start using the supplemental battery.  Battery gas is flammable and explosive.  Keep flame or sparks away from the battery.  Do not use a booster battery or any other booster source with an output greater than 12 Volts.  Do not allow cable clamps to touch each other.  Battery posts, terminals, and related accessories contain lead and lead compounds.  Wash hands after handling.  If a “fast charger” is used while the battery is in the vehicle, disconnect both vehicle battery cables before connecting the charger to the battery.  Do not use a “fast charger” to provide starting.  Note: the positive (+) battery post is covered with a protective cap.  Lift up on the cap to gain access to the post.

GraphRAG Score: 13Question: Any tips for driving downhill?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  If the engine stalls or you lose headway or cannot make it to the top of a steep hill or grade, never attempt to turn around.  To do so may result in tipping and rolling the vehicle, which may result in severe injury.  Always back carefully straight down a hill in REVERSE.  Never back down a hill in NEUTRAL using only the vehicle brakes.  Never drive diagonally across a hill, always drive straight up or down.  Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  Moving from a high gear down to a lower gear is recommended to preserve brakes when driving down steep hills.  In addition, downshifting at the right time provides better acceleration when you desire to resume speed.  Downshift progressively.  Do not skip gears to avoid overspeeding the engine and clutch.
 Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.

Answer: When driving downhill, it's important to first assess if the hill is too steep for a safe descent. Consider the surface traction, the steepness of the grade, any obstacles, whether the descent is straight, and if there's enough distance at the base to regain control if needed. If you feel confident to proceed, ensure you are in 4L (four-wheel drive, low range) and proceed with caution. Use engine braking to control the descent and apply brakes if necessary, but avoid locking the tires. Do not descend in NEUTRAL; use vehicle brakes along with engine braking. Downshift progressively to preserve brakes and avoid overspeeding the engine and clutch.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Engine Warm-Up Avoid full throttle operation when the engine is cold.  When starting a cold engine, bring the engine up to operating speed slowly to allow the oil pressure to stabilize as the engine warms up.  If temperatures are below 32°F (0°C), operate the engine at moderate speeds for five minutes before full loads are applied.
 Engine start-up in very low ambient temperature could result in evident white smoke.  This condition will disappear as the engine warms up.  Warm up the engine before placing it under load.

GraphRAG Score: 18Question: how to do the ignition actuated test?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  If you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  Starting with the ignition in the OFF position.  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (instrument cluster will display “ACC”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a third time to return the ignition to the OFF position (instrument cluster will display “OFF”).
 Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: The message will stay active until the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN position.  Starting with the ignition in the OFF position.  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (instrument cluster will display “ACC”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a third time to return the ignition to the OFF position (instrument cluster will display “OFF”).  The START/STOP ignition button has several operating modes that are labeled and will illuminate when in position.  These modes are OFF, ACC, RUN, and START.  Unless reset, this message will continue to display each time you place the ignition in the ON/RUN position.  To turn off the message temporarily, push and release the ok button.  To reset the oil change indicator system (after performing the scheduled maintenance), refer to the following procedure.  To insert an Auxiliary device, gently insert the Auxiliary device cable into the AUX port.  If you insert an Auxiliary device with the ignition and the radio on, the unit will switch to AUX Mode and begin to play.  The system will automatically time out and the ignition will cycle to the OFF position after 30 minutes of inactivity if the ignition is left in the ACC or RUN (engine not running) position and the transmission is in PARK.  For Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ equipped vehicles, the engine will turn off and the ignition will change to ACC position.  After 30 minutes the ignition switches to OFF automatically, unless the driver turns the ignition OFF.  If you must use the accessories (wipers, defrosters, etc.)  while being towed, the ignition must be in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.  The Power Inverter will only turn on if the ignition is in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  Due to built-in overload protection, the power inverter will turn off if the power rating is exceeded.
Answer: To perform the ignition actuated test to check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, follow these steps:

1. Start with the ignition in the OFF position.
2. Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (the instrument cluster will display “ACC”).
3. Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (the instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”).

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  If the temperature is below 72°F (24°C) and/or the top has been folded down for a period of time, the top will appear to have shrunk when you raise it, making it difficult to put up.  This is caused by a natural contraction of the vinyl or acrylic materials of the fabric top.  If required for certain off-road uses, the windshield can be folded down.  However, the protection afforded by the windshield is then lost.  If you fold down the windshield, drive slowly and cautiously.  It is recommended that the speed of the vehicle be limited to 10 mph (16 km/h), with low range operation preferred if you are driving off-road with the windshield folded down.  The fold-down windshield on your vehicle is a structural element that can provide protection in some accidents.  The windshield also provides protection against weather, road debris and intrusion of small branches and other objects.  To fold down the rear seat, pull the release strap located on the upper outboard side of the rear seat to release the seat.  The head restraints are folded independently Position the latch plate as close as possible to the anchor point.  At about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) above the latch plate, grab and twist the seat belt webbing 180 degrees to create a fold that begins immediately above the latch plate.  Slide the latch plate upward over the folded webbing.  The folded webbing must enter the slot at the top of the latch plate.  Continue to slide the latch plate up until it clears the folded webbing and the seat belt is no longer twisted.  Be sure that the front seats are fully upright and positioned forward.  This will allow the rear seat to fold down easily.  The center head restraints must be in the lowest position to avoid contact with the center console when folding the seat.  Do not drive your vehicle on-road with the windshield down.  Do not drive your vehicle unless the windshield is securely fastened, either up or down.  Eye protection, such as goggles, should be worn at all times when the windshield is down.  Be sure that you carefully follow the instructions for raising the windshield.  Make sure that the folding windshield, windshield wipers, side bars, and all associated hardware and fasteners are correctly and tightly assembled before driving your vehicle.  Failure to follow these instructions may prevent your vehicle from providing you and your passengers’ protection in some accidents.  If you remove the doors, store them outside the vehicle.  In the event of an accident, a loose door may cause personal injury.

The windshield also provides protection against weather, road debris and intrusion of small branches and other objects.  Do not drive your vehicle on-road with the windshield down.  Do not drive your vehicle unless the windshield is securely fastened, either up or down.  Eye protection, such as goggles, should be worn at all times when the windshield is down.  Be sure that you carefully follow the instructions for raising the windshield.  Make sure that the folding windshield, windshield wipers, side bars, and all associated hardware and fasteners are correctly and tightly assembled before driving your vehicle.  Failure to follow these instructions may prevent your vehicle from providing you and your passengers’ protection in some accidents.  If you remove the doors, store them outside the vehicle.  In the event of an accident, a loose door may cause personal injury.  Raise the windshield as soon as the task that required its removal is completed and before you return to on-road driving.  Both you and your passengers should wear seat belts at all times, on-road and off-road, regardless of whether the windshield is raised or folded down.
Answer: The context advises against keeping the top folded down for a long time, as it may appear to have shrunk when you raise it, making it difficult to put up. This is due to the natural contraction of the vinyl or acrylic materials of the fabric top, especially if the temperature is below 72°F (24°C).

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Passengers should not remain in the vehicle when the vehicle is being jacked in position.  Do not attempt to change a tire on the side of the vehicle close to moving traffic.  Pull far enough off the road to avoid the danger of being hit when operating the jack or changing the wheel.  Being under a jacked-up vehicle is dangerous.  The vehicle could slip off the jack and fall on you.  You could be crushed.  Never put any part of your body under a vehicle that is on a jack.  If you need to get under a raised vehicle, take the vehicle to a service center where it can be raised on a lift.  Never start or run the engine while the vehicle is on a jack.  The jack is designed to be used as a tool for changing tires only.  The jack should not be used to lift the vehicle for service purposes.  The vehicle should be jacked on a firm level surface only.  Avoid ice or slippery areas.  Do not attempt to raise the vehicle by jacking on locations other than those indicated.
 If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  Do not attempt to change a tire on the side of the vehicle close to moving traffic.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.
 Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver’s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats.
Answer: You should fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears and release it as you lightly press the accelerator pedal. Additionally, be aware that a certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal, especially when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released) or when the transmission is warm. This noise is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Towing Tips Before towing, practice turning, stopping and backing the trailer in an area away from heavy traffic.  If using a manual transmission vehicle for trailer towing, all starts must be in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.  TRAILER TOWING In this section you will find safety tips and information on limits to the type of towing you can reasonably do with your vehicle.  Before towing a trailer, carefully review this information to tow your load as efficiently and safely as possible.  To maintain the New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage, follow the requirements and recommendations in this manual concerning vehicles used for trailer towing.  TOWING A DISABLED VEHICLE This section describes procedures for towing a disabled vehicle using a commercial towing service.  If the transmission and drivetrain are operable, disabled vehicles may also be towed as described on Proper towing or lifting equipment is required to prevent damage to your vehicle.  Use only tow bars and other equipment designed for this purpose, following equipment manufacturer’s instructions.  Use of safety chains is mandatory.  Attach a tow bar or other towing device to main structural members of the vehicle, not to fascia/bumpers or associated brackets.  State and local laws regarding vehicles under tow must be observed.  If you must use the accessories (wipers, defrosters, etc.)  while being towed, the ignition must be in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.  If the vehicle's battery is discharged, instructions on shifting the automatic transmission out of PARK (P) in order to move the vehicle CAUTION: Do not use sling type equipment when towing.  Vehicle damage may occur.  When securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck, do not attach to front or rear suspension components.  Damage to your vehicle may result from improper towing.
 Towing Requirements To promote proper break-in of your new vehicle drivetrain components, the following guidelines are recommended: WARNING: Improper towing can lead to a collision.  Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel.  When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control.  You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision.  When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer.  Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires.  Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer.  Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.  Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.  Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade.  When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle.  Put the tow vehicle transmission in PARK.  Always block or "chock" the trailer wheels.  GCWR must not be exceeded.  Total weight must be distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer such that the following four ratings are not exceeded: gvwr gtw gawr tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized caution: do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles (805 km) the new vehicle is driven.  The engine, axle or other parts could be damaged.  Then, during the first 500 miles (805 km) that a trailer is towed, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and do not make starts at full throttle.  This helps the engine and other parts of the vehicle wear in at the heavier loads.
Answer: When towing a car, you should pay attention to the following:

1. Use proper towing or lifting equipment to prevent damage to your vehicle. Only use tow bars and other equipment designed for towing, following the manufacturer's instructions.

2. Use safety chains, attaching them to the main structural members of the vehicle, not to the fascia/bumpers or associated brackets. Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.

3. Observe state and local laws regarding vehicles under tow.

4. If you need to use accessories like wipers or defrosters while being towed, ensure the ignition is in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.

5. Avoid using sling-type equipment, as it may cause vehicle damage.

6. When securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck, do not attach to front or rear suspension components to avoid damage.

7. Ensure the load is secured in the trailer to prevent dynamic load shifts that could lead to loss of control.

8. Do not overload the vehicle or trailer, as it can cause loss of control, poor performance, or damage to various vehicle components.

9. Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade. When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle, put the transmission in PARK, and block or "chock" the trailer wheels.

10. Do not exceed the Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR) and ensure the weight is distributed properly between the tow vehicle and the trailer.

11. Do not tow a trailer during the first 500 miles (805 km) of driving a new vehicle to avoid damaging the engine, axle, or other parts. During the first 500 miles (805 km) of towing, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and avoid full-throttle starts to allow the vehicle to wear in under heavier loads.

Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel.  When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control.  You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision.  When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer.  Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires.  Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer.  Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.

Answer: When towing a car, you should pay attention to the following:

1. **Practice**: Before towing, practice turning, stopping, and backing the trailer in an area away from heavy traffic.

2. **Transmission**: If using a manual transmission vehicle for towing, start in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.

3. **Safety Chains**: Always use safety chains between your vehicle and the trailer. Connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch, cross them under the trailer tongue, and allow enough slack for turning corners.

4. **Load Security**: Ensure the load is secured in the trailer to prevent shifting during travel, which can lead to loss of control.

5. **Avoid Overloading**: Do not overload your vehicle or trailer, as it can cause loss of control, poor performance, or damage to various vehicle components.

6. **Parking**: Do not park vehicles with trailers on a grade. Apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle, put the transmission in PARK, and block or "chock" the trailer wheels.

7. **Weight Ratings**: Ensure that the Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR), Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR), Gross Trailer Weight (GTW), Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR), and tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch are not exceeded.

8. **Break-in Period**: Do not tow a trailer during the first 500 miles (805 km) of driving a new vehicle. After that, for the next 500 miles (805 km) of towing, do not exceed 50 mph (80 km/h) and avoid full-throttle starts.

9. **Towing Equipment**: Use proper towing or lifting equipment to prevent vehicle damage. Avoid using sling-type equipment and do not attach to front or rear suspension components when securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck.

10. **Legal Compliance**: Observe state and local laws regarding vehicles under tow.

11. **Ignition Position**: If you need to use accessories while being towed, keep the ignition in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a safer towing experience and help maintain your vehicle's warranty coverage.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  When using a portable battery booster pack, follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and precautions.  Do not use a portable battery booster pack or any other booster source with a system voltage greater than 12 Volts or damage to the battery, starter motor, alternator or electrical system may occur.  If your vehicle has a discharged battery, it can be jump started using a set of jumper cables and a battery in another vehicle, or by using a portable battery booster pack.  Jump starting can be dangerous if done improperly, so please follow the procedures in this section carefully.
 JUMP STARTING If your vehicle has a discharged battery, it can be jump started using a set of jumper cables and a battery in another vehicle, or by using a portable battery booster pack.  Jump starting can be dangerous if done improperly, so please follow the procedures in this section carefully.  WARNING: Do not attempt jump starting if the battery is frozen.  It could rupture or explode and cause personal injury.  CAUTION: Do not use a portable battery booster pack or any other booster source with a system voltage greater than 12 Volts or damage to the battery, starter motor, alternator or electrical system may occur.  Note: When using a portable battery booster pack, follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and precautions.  Maintenance-Free Battery Your vehicle is equipped with a maintenance-free battery.  You will never have to add water, and periodic maintenance is not required.  WARNING: Battery fluid is a corrosive acid solution and can burn or even blind you.  Do not allow battery fluid to contact your eyes, skin, or clothing.  Do not lean over a battery when attaching clamps.  If acid splashes in eyes or on skin, flush the area immediately with large amounts of water Battery gas is flammable and explosive.  Keep flame or sparks away from the battery.  Do not use a booster battery or any other booster source with an output greater than 12 Volts.  Do not allow cable clamps to touch each other.  Battery posts, terminals, and related accessories contain lead and lead compounds.  Wash hands after handling.  Vehicles with the Stop/Start system will be equipped with two batteries.  Both the main and the supplemental batteries must be disconnected to completely de-energize the 12 Volt electrical system.  Serious injury or death could result if you do not disconnect both batteries.  To learn how to properly disconnect, see an authorized dealer.  CAUTION: It is essential when replacing the cables on the battery that the positive cable is attached to the positive post and the negative cable is attached to the negative post.  Battery posts are marked positive (+) and negative (-) and are identified on the battery case.  Cable clamps should be tight on the terminal posts and free of corrosion.  If a “fast charger” is used while the battery is in the vehicle, disconnect both vehicle battery cables before connecting the charger to the battery.  Do not use a “fast charger” to provide starting voltage.  Vehicles with the Stop/Start system will be equipped with two batteries.  Both the main and the supplemental batteries must be disconnected to completely de-energize the 12 Volt electrical system.  If the negative battery cables are not isolated properly it can cause a potential power spike or surge in the system, resulting in damage to essential electrical components.  Disconnecting the jumper cables disconnect the negative (-) end of the jumper cable from the engine ground of the vehicle with the discharged battery.  Disconnect the opposite end of the negative (-) jumper cable from the negative (-) post of the booster battery.  Disconnect the positive (+) end of the jumper cable from the positive (+) post of the booster battery.  Disconnect the opposite end of the positive (+) jumper cable from the positive (+) post of the discharged vehicle.  Reinstall the protective cover over the positive (+) post of the discharged vehicle.  If frequent jump starting is required to start your vehicle you should have the battery and charging system tested at an authorized dealer.  CAUTION: Accessories plugged into the vehicle power outlets draw power from the vehicle’s battery, even when not in use (i.e., cellular devices, etc.).  Eventually, if plugged in long enough without engine operation, the vehicle’s battery will discharge sufficiently to degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from starting.
Answer: Yes, there are specific requirements for the portable battery booster pack:

1. The system voltage of the portable battery booster pack must not be greater than 12 Volts to avoid damage to the battery, starter motor, alternator, or electrical system.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.
 Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.  Driving Downhill Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  WARNING: Do not descend a steep grade in NEUTRAL.  Use vehicle brakes in conjunction with engine braking.  Descending a grade too fast could cause you to lose control and be seriously injured or killed.  Off-Road Driving Tips
Answer: If you have to drive across an incline, here are some tips:

1. Know your vehicle's abilities.
2. Ensure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.
3. Transverse the incline at an angle, heading slightly up or down if possible.
4. Be aware that driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.

Notice the visual cues that inform you of your Voice Recognition system’s status.
 Helpful hints for using Voice Recognition: Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure.  Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the “Listen” prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.  The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped.

Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  Note: It is recommended that the Stop/Start system be disabled during off-road use.  WARNING: Always wear your seat belt and firmly tie down cargo.  Unsecured cargo can become projectiles in an off-road situation.  CAUTION: Never park your vehicle over dry grass or other combustible materials.  The heat from your vehicle exhaust system could cause a fire.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  If you store quantities of fuel, good maintenance of the stored fuel is also essential.  Fuel contaminated with water will promote the growth of “microbes.” These microbes form “slime” that will clog the fuel filtration system and lines.  Drain condensation from the supply tank and change the line filter on a regular basis.  Fuel that is contaminated by water or dirt can cause severe damage to the engine fuel system.  Proper maintenance of the engine fuel filter and fuel tank is essential see Never pour fuel or other flammable liquid into the throttle body air inlet opening in an attempt to start the vehicle.  This could result in flash fire causing serious personal injury.  Do not attempt to push or tow your vehicle to get it started.  Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission cannot be started this way.  Unburned fuel could enter the catalytic converter and once the engine has started, ignite and damage the converter and vehicle.  If the vehicle has a discharged battery, booster cables may be used to obtain a start from a booster battery or the battery in another vehicle.  This type of start can be dangerous if done improperly The use of leaded gasoline is prohibited by Federal law.  Using leaded gasoline can impair engine performance and damage the emissions control system.  An out-of-tune engine, certain fuel or ignition malfunctions can cause the catalytic converter to overheat.  If you notice a pungent burning odor or some light smoke, your engine may be out-of-tune or malfunctioning and may require immediate service.  Contact an authorized dealer for service assistance.  The use of fuel additives, which are now being sold as octane enhancers, is not recommended.  Most of these products contain high concentrations of methanol.  Fuel system damage or vehicle performance problems resulting from the use of such fuels or additives is not the responsibility of The manufacturer and may void or not be covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  The engine requires the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.  Use of incorrect fuel could result in engine and exhaust system damage If climatized or Number 1 ULSD fuel is not available, and you are operating below 20°F (-6°C), in sustained arctic conditions, Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment (or equivalent) is recommended to avoid gelling (see Fuel Operating Range Chart).  Due to lack of lubricants in alcohol or gasoline, the use of these fuels can cause damage to the fuel system.  Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  If the vehicle is exposed to extreme cold (below 20°F or -7°C), or is required to operate at colder-than-normal conditions for prolonged periods, use climatized Number 2 diesel fuel or dilute the Number 2 diesel fuel with 50% Number 1 diesel fuel.  This will provide better protection from fuel gelling or wax-plugging of the fuel filters.  Use of biodiesel mixture in excess of 20% can negatively impact the fuel filter's ability to separate water from the fuel, resulting in high pressure fuel system corrosion or damage.  In addition, commercially available fuel additives are not necessary for the proper operation of your diesel engine.  For extreme cold conditions, "Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment" is recommended to assist with cold starting.  The presence of water in the fuel system circuit may cause severe damage to the injection system and irregular engine operation.  If the indicator light is illuminated, contact an authorized dealer as soon as possible to bleed the system.  If the previously mentioned indicators come on immediately after refueling, water or AdBlue® (UREA) have probably been poured into the tank: switch the engine off immediately and contact an authorized dealer.

GraphRAG Score: 38Question: what should I do before sending the car to the emission inspection?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  Do not inhale exhaust gases.  They contain carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, which can kill.  Never run the engine in a closed area, such as a garage, and never sit in a parked vehicle with the engine running for an extended period.  If the vehicle is stopped in an open area with the engine running for more than a short period, adjust the ventilation system to force fresh, outside air into the vehicle.  Guard against carbon monoxide with proper maintenance.  Have the exhaust system inspected every time the vehicle is raised.  Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly.  Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open.  Your vehicle is equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to meet the very stringent diesel emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency.
 EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  For states and/or provinces that require an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is functioning and is not on when the engine is running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  Note: if you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: the mil will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn off the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  If your obd ii system is not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.  If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive your vehicle as you normally would in order for your OBD II system to update.  A recheck with the previously mentioned test routine may then indicate that the system is now ready.  Regardless of whether your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, if the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation you should have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station.  The I/M station can fail your vehicle because the MIL is on with the engine running.  Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ Ignition This feature allows the driver to operate the ignition switch with the push of a START/STOP ignition button as long as the key fob is in the passenger compartment.  The START/STOP ignition button has several operating modes that are labeled and will illuminate when in position.  These modes are OFF, ACC, RUN, and START.  The push button ignition can be placed in the following modes: Enhanced Accident Response System Reset Procedure In order to reset the Enhanced Accident Response System functions after an event, the ignition switch must be changed from ignition START or ON/RUN to ignition OFF.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  After an accident, if the vehicle will not start after performing the reset procedure, the vehicle must be towed to an authorized dealer to be inspected and to have the Enhanced Accident Response System reset.
Answer: Before sending the car to the emission inspection, you should:

1. Check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready by performing the ignition actuated test:
   - Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position without cranking or starting the engine.
   - Observe the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol. If it flashes for about 10 seconds and then remains fully illuminated, the OBD II system is not ready. If it does not flash and remains fully illuminated, the system is ready.

2. If the OBD II system is not ready, consider seeing an authorized dealer or repair facility.

3. If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, drive your vehicle normally to allow the OBD II system to update, and then recheck the system readiness.

4. Ensure the MIL is not illuminated during normal vehicle operation, as this could cause the vehicle to fail the inspection.

5. If the MIL is illuminated, have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station.

Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  For states and/or provinces that require an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is functioning and is not on when the engine is running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle\'s OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  Note: if you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: the mil will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn off the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle\'s obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle\'s obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  If your obd ii system is not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.  If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive your vehicle as you normally would in order for your OBD II system to update.  A recheck with the previously mentioned test routine may then indicate that the system is now ready.  Regardless of whether your vehicle\'s OBD II system is ready, if the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation you should have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station.  The I/M station can fail your vehicle because the MIL is on with the engine running.  Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ Ignition This feature allows the driver to operate the ignition switch with the push of a START/STOP ignition button as long as the key fob is in the passenger compartment.  The START/STOP ignition button has several operating modes that are labeled and will illuminate when in position.  These modes are OFF, ACC, RUN, and START.  The push button ignition can be placed in the following modes: Enhanced Accident Response System Reset Procedure In order to reset the Enhanced Accident Response System functions after an event, the ignition switch must be changed from ignition START or ON/RUN to ignition OFF.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  After an accident, if the vehicle will not start after performing the reset procedure, the vehicle must be towed to an authorized dealer to be inspected and to have the Enhanced Accident Response System reset.", \'embedding\': None}', metadata={'score': 0.8654632568359375, 'nodeLabels': ['__KGBuilder__', 'Chunk'], 'id': '4:df0351a0-8506-4029-b91e-160a8bda09e5:436'})]
Answer: Before sending your car to the emission inspection, you should check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready. To do this, cycle the ignition switch to the ON position without cranking or starting the engine. Observe the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol, which will come on as part of a normal bulb check. Approximately 15 seconds later, if the MIL flashes for about 10 seconds and then remains fully illuminated, your vehicle's OBD II system is not ready, and you should not proceed to the inspection station. If the MIL does not flash and remains fully illuminated, your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, and you can proceed to the inspection station. If your OBD II system is not ready, consider seeing an authorized dealer or repair facility. Additionally, if your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to drive your vehicle normally to allow the OBD II system to update. If the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation, have your vehicle serviced before going to the inspection station, as the station can fail your vehicle if the MIL is on with the engine running.

You have 10 seconds after pushing the SOS Call button to cancel the call.  To cancel the call, either push the SOS Call button again, or press the Cancel button on the in-vehicle touchscreen.  What type of information is sent when I use the SOS Call button from my vehicle?  Certain vehicle information, such as make and model, is transmitted along with the last known GPS location.  When could I use the SOS Call button?  You can use the SOS Call button to make a call if you or someone else needs emergency assistance.
 SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle’s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle’s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle’s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle’s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle’s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle’s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle’s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.

Context:  BED RAIL TIE DOWN SYSTEM — IF EQUIPPED The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  There are two adjustable utility rail cleats on each side of the bed that can be used to assist in securing cargo.  Each utility rail cleat must be tightened down in one of the detents along either utility rail in order to keep cargo properly secured.  To move the utility rail cleat to any position on the utility rail, turn the cleat retainer nut counterclockwise several times.  Then, pull out on the utility rail cleat and slide it to the detent nearest the desired location.  Make sure the utility rail cleat is seated in the detent, and tighten the nut.  To remove the utility rail cleats from the side utility rails, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located at the end of the rail toward the front of the vehicle.  To remove the utility rail cleat from the front utility rail, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located on the left side of the rail.  CAUTION: The maximum load per cleat should not exceed 250 lb (113 kg) and the angle of the load on each cleat should not exceed 45 degrees above horizontal, or damage to the cleat or cleat rail may occur.  Lower Anchors And Tethers For CHildren (LATCH) Your vehicle is equipped with the child restraint anchorage system called LATCH, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren.  The LATCH system has three vehicle anchor points for installing LATCH-equipped child seats.  There are two lower anchorages located at the back of the seat cushion where it meets the seatback and one top tether anchorage located behind the seating position.  These anchorages are used to install LATCH-equipped child seats without using the vehicle’s seat belts.  Some seating positions may have a top tether anchorage but no lower anchorages.  In these seating positions, the seat belt must be used with the top tether anchorage to install the child restraint.  Please see the following table for more information.
 Weight-Distributing Hitch A Weight-Distributing Hitch system works by applying leverage through spring (load) bars.  They are typically used for heavier loads to distribute trailer tongue weight to the tow vehicle's front axle and the trailer axle(s).  When used in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, it provides for a more level ride, offering more consistent steering and brake control thereby enhancing towing safety.  The addition of a friction/hydraulic sway control also dampens sway caused by traffic and crosswinds and contributes positively to tow vehicle and trailer stability.  Trailer sway control and a Weight-Distributing (load equalizing) Hitch are recommended for heavier Tongue Weights (TW) and may be required depending on vehicle and trailer configuration/loading to comply with Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) requirements.  WARNING: An improperly adjusted Weight-Distributing Hitch system may reduce handling, stability, braking performance, and could result in a collision.  Weight-Distributing Hitch systems may not be compatible with surge brake couplers.  Consult with your hitch and trailer manufacturer or a reputable Recreational Vehicle dealer for additional information.

Context:  ROLLOVER WARNING Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.  This vehicle has a higher ground clearance and a higher center of gravity than many passenger vehicles.  It is capable of performing better in a wide variety of off-road applications.  Driven in an unsafe manner, all vehicles can go out of control.  Because of the higher center of gravity, if this vehicle is out of control it may roll over while some other vehicles may not.  Do not attempt sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions that can cause loss of vehicle control.  Failure to operate this vehicle safely may result in a collision, rollover of the vehicle, and severe or fatal injury.  Drive carefully.  Failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury.  In fact, the US government notes that the universal use of existing seat belts could cut the highway death toll by 10,000 or more each year and could reduce disabling injuries by two million annually.  In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.  Always buckle up.

After going off-road, it is always a good idea to check for damage.  That way you can get any problems taken care of right away and have your vehicle ready when you need it.  Completely inspect the underbody of your vehicle.  Check tires, body structure, steering, suspension, driveline, and exhaust system for damage.  Inspect the radiator for mud and debris and clean as required.  Check threaded fasteners for looseness, particularly on the chassis, drivetrain components, steering, and suspension.  Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Note: inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Warning: abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.

IF YOUR ENGINE OVERHEATS If the vehicle is overheating, it will need to be serviced by an authorized dealer.  Potential signs of vehicle overheating: temperature gauge is at hot (h) strong smell of coolant white smoke coming from engine or exhaust coolant bottle coolant has bubbles present in the event it is observed that the temperature gauge is moving towards or close to the hot (h) position, you can reduce the potential for overheating by taking the appropriate action.  On the highways — slow down.  In city traffic — while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL (N), but do not increase the engine idle speed while preventing vehicle motion with the brakes.  If your Air Conditioner (A/C) is on, turn it off.  The A/C system adds heat to the engine cooling system and turning the A/C off can help remove this heat.  You can also turn the temperature control to maximum heat, the mode control to floor and the blower control to high.  This allows the heater core to act as a supplement to the radiator and aids in removing heat from the engine cooling system.  WARNING: You or others can be badly burned by hot engine coolant (antifreeze) or steam from your radiator.  If you see or hear steam coming from under the hood, do not open the hood until the radiator has had time to cool.  Never try to open a cooling system pressure cap when the radiator or coolant bottle is hot.  CAUTION: Driving with a hot cooling system could damage your vehicle.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  For states and/or provinces that require an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is functioning and is not on when the engine is running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  Note: if you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: the mil will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn off the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  If your obd ii system is not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.  If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive your vehicle as you normally would in order for your OBD II system to update.  A recheck with the previously mentioned test routine may then indicate that the system is now ready.  Regardless of whether your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, if the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation you should have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station.  The I/M station can fail your vehicle because the MIL is on with the engine running.  Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ Ignition This feature allows the driver to operate the ignition switch with the push of a START/STOP ignition button as long as the key fob is in the passenger compartment.

The push button ignition can be placed in the following modes: Enhanced Accident Response System Reset Procedure In order to reset the Enhanced Accident Response System functions after an event, the ignition switch must be changed from ignition START or ON/RUN to ignition OFF.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  After an accident, if the vehicle will not start after performing the reset procedure, the vehicle must be towed to an authorized dealer to be inspected and to have the Enhanced Accident Response System reset.

This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  Prolonged driving with the MIL on could cause further damage to the emission control system.  It could also affect fuel economy and driveability.  The vehicle must be serviced before any emissions tests can be performed.  If the MIL is flashing while the vehicle is running, severe catalytic converter damage and power loss will soon occur.  Immediate service is required.
Answer: Yes, here is a step-by-step instruction to check whether the Onboard Diagnostic (OBD II) system is ready for the emissions inspection:

1. **Cycle the Ignition Switch**: Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. Do not crank or start the engine. If you accidentally start the engine, you will need to start the test over.

2. **Observe the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL)**: As soon as you turn the ignition switch to the ON position, the MIL symbol will illuminate as part of a normal bulb check.

3. **Wait for 15 Seconds**: Approximately 15 seconds after turning the ignition to the ON position, observe the MIL for one of the following outcomes:
   - **MIL Flashes**: If the MIL flashes for about 10 seconds and then returns to being fully illuminated, your vehicle's OBD II system is not ready. Do not proceed to the inspection and maintenance (I/M) station.
   - **MIL Does Not Flash**: If the MIL does not flash and remains fully illuminated, your vehicle's OBD II system is ready. You can proceed to the I/M station.

4. **If Not Ready**: If the OBD II system is not ready, consider seeing an authorized dealer or repair facility. If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery issue, you may need to drive it normally to allow the system to update. Recheck using the test routine to see if the system is now ready.

5. **Service if Necessary**: Regardless of readiness, if the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation, have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station, as the station can fail your vehicle if the MIL is on with the engine running.

Pull far enough off the road to avoid the danger of being hit when operating the jack or changing the wheel.  Being under a jacked-up vehicle is dangerous.  The vehicle could slip off the jack and fall on you.  You could be crushed.  Never put any part of your body under a vehicle that is on a jack.  If you need to get under a raised vehicle, take the vehicle to a service center where it can be raised on a lift.  Never start or run the engine while the vehicle is on a jack.  The jack is designed to be used as a tool for changing tires only.  The jack should not be used to lift the vehicle for service purposes.  The vehicle should be jacked on a firm level surface only.  Avoid ice or slippery areas.  Completely inspect the underbody of your vehicle.  Check tires, body structure, steering, suspension, driveline, and exhaust system for damage.  Inspect the radiator for mud and debris and clean as required.  Check threaded fasteners for looseness, particularly on the chassis, drivetrain components, steering, and suspension.  Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.  If you experience unusual vibration after driving in mud, slush or similar conditions, check the wheels for impacted material.  Impacted material can cause a wheel imbalance and freeing the wheels of it will correct the situation.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle’s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle’s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle’s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle’s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle’s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle’s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle’s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  With Remote Start, the engine will only run for 15 minutes.  Remote Start can only be used twice.  If an engine fault is present or fuel level is low, the vehicle will start and then shut down in 10 seconds.  The parking lights will turn on and remain on during Remote Start mode.  For security, power window operation is disabled when the vehicle is in the Remote Start mode.  The ignition must be placed in the ON/RUN position before the Remote Start sequence can be repeated for a third cycle.  For information on use with the Remote Start system, see These features will stay on through the duration of Remote Start, or until the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN position.  The climate control settings will change if manually adjusted by the driver while the vehicle is in remote start mode.  This includes turning the climate controls off using the OFF button.
 Description The Remote Vehicle Start feature provides you with the ability to start the engine on your vehicle without the keys and from virtually any distance.  Once started, the preset climate controls in your vehicle can warm up or cool down the interior.  You can also send a command to turn off an engine that has been started using Remote Vehicle Start.  After 15 minutes, if you have not entered your vehicle with the key, the engine will shut off automatically.  This remote function requires your vehicle to be equipped with a factory-installed Remote Start system.  You can set up push notifications every time a command is sent to activate or cancel Remote Start.  REMOTE START — IF EQUIPPED (DIESEL) This system uses the key fob to start the engine conveniently from outside the vehicle while still maintaining security.  The system has a range of approximately 328 ft (100 m).  Remote Start is used to defrost windows in cold weather, and to reach a comfortable climate in all ambient conditions before the driver enters the vehicle.  Note: The vehicle must be equipped with an automatic transmission to be equipped with Remote Start.  Obstructions between the vehicle and the key fob may reduce this range.  The Remote Start system will wait for the Wait To Start yellow telltale to extinguish before cranking the engine This allows time for the engine preheat cycle to heat the cylinder air, and is normal in cold weather.  WARNING: Do not start or run an engine in a closed garage or confined area.  Exhaust gas contains carbon monoxide (CO) which is odorless and colorless.  Carbon monoxide is poisonous and can cause serious injury or death when inhaled.  Keep key fobs away from children.  Operation of the Remote Start system, windows, door locks or other controls could cause serious injury or death.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  The trailcam view can also be activated by pressing the icon on the back up camera view.  The back up camera view can also be activated by pressing the icon on the trailcam view.  If weather conditions are not a factor, the driver should examine the windshield and the camera located on the back side of the inside rearview mirror.  They may require cleaning or removal of an obstruction.  Rear Cross Path Detection (RCP) is not a backup aid system.  It is intended to be used to help a driver detect an oncoming vehicle in a parking lot situation.  Drivers must be careful when backing up, even when using RCP.  Always check carefully behind your vehicle, look behind you, and be sure to check for pedestrians, animals, other vehicles, obstructions, and blind spots before backing up.  Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.
 Whenever the Rear View Camera image is activated through the Back Up Camera button in the Controls menu, and the vehicle speed is greater than, or equal to 8 mph (13 km/h), a display timer for the image is initiated.  The image will continue to be displayed until the display timer exceeds 10 seconds.  Different colored zones indicate the distance to the rear of the vehicle.  The ParkView Rear Back Up Camera allows you to see an on-screen image of the rear surroundings of your vehicle whenever the gear selector is in REVERSE.  The image will be displayed in the touchscreen display along with a caution note to “Check Entire Surroundings” across the top of the screen.  After five seconds this note will disappear.  The ParkView camera is located on the tailgate, above the vehicle license plate.
Answer: Yes, the ParkView Rear Back Up Camera can show an on-screen image of the rear surroundings of the vehicle, which includes different colored zones indicating the distance to the rear of the vehicle. This helps in visualizing the back up path.

GraphRAG Score: 47Question: Any tips about how to keep the air inside fresh?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Outside Air Intake Make sure the air intake, located directly in front of the windshield, is free of obstructions, such as leaves.  Leaves collected in the air intake may reduce airflow, and if they enter the air distribution box, they could plug the water drains.  In Winter months, make sure the air intake is clear of ice, slush, and snow.
 Window Fogging Vehicle windows tend to fog on the inside in mild, rainy, and/or humid weather.  To clear the windows, select Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed.  Do not use the Recirculation mode without A/C for long periods, as fogging may occur.
Answer: Make sure the air intake, located directly in front of the windshield, is free of obstructions like leaves, ice, slush, and snow. This ensures proper airflow and prevents blockages in the air distribution system.

Whenever a change is noticed in the sound of the exhaust system, when exhaust fumes can be detected inside the vehicle, or when the underside or rear of the vehicle is damaged, have an authorized dealer inspect the complete exhaust system and adjacent body areas for broken, damaged, deteriorated, or mispositioned parts.  Open seams or loose connections could permit exhaust fumes to seep into the passenger compartment.  In addition, inspect the exhaust system each time the vehicle is raised for lubrication or oil change.  Replace as required.  WARNING: Exhaust gases can injure or kill.  They contain carbon monoxide (CO), which is colorless and odorless.  Breathing it can make you unconscious and can eventually poison you.  To avoid breathing (CO), follow these safety tips: Do not run the engine in a closed garage or in confined areas any longer than needed to move your vehicle in or out of the area.  If you are required to drive with the trunk/liftgate/rear doors open, make sure that all windows are closed and the climate control BLOWER switch is set at high speed.  DO NOT use the recirculation mode.  If it is necessary to sit in a parked vehicle with the engine running, adjust your heating or cooling controls to force outside air into the vehicle.  Set the blower at high speed.  Carbon Monoxide Warnings WARNING: Carbon monoxide (CO) in exhaust gases is deadly.  Follow the precautions below to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning: Do not inhale exhaust gases.  They contain carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, which can kill.  Never run the engine in a closed area, such as a garage, and never sit in a parked vehicle with the engine running for an extended period.  If the vehicle is stopped in an open area with the engine running for more than a short period, adjust the ventilation system to force fresh, outside air into the vehicle.  Guard against carbon monoxide with proper maintenance.  Have the exhaust system inspected every time the vehicle is raised.  Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly.  Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open.  Charge Air Cooler — Inter-Cooler (Diesel Engine) The charge air cooler is positioned in front of the radiator and the air conditioner condenser.  Air enters the engine through the air cleaner and passes through the turbocharger, where it is pressurized.  This pressurized air rapidly reaches high temperature.  The air is then directed through a hose to the charge air cooler and through another hose to the intake manifold of the engine.

GraphRAG Score: 48Question: What is the brake warning light used for?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Brake Warning Light This warning light monitors various brake functions, including brake fluid level and parking brake application.  If the brake light turns on it may indicate that the parking brake is applied, that the brake fluid level is low, or that there is a problem with the Anti-Lock Brake System reservoir.  If the light remains on when the parking brake has been disengaged, and the fluid level is at the full mark on the master cylinder reservoir, it indicates a possible brake hydraulic system malfunction or that a problem with the Brake Booster has been detected by the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) / Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system.  In this case, the light will remain on until the condition has been corrected.  If the problem is related to the brake booster, the ABS pump will run when applying the brake, and a brake pedal pulsation may be felt during each stop.  The dual brake system provides a reserve braking capacity in the event of a failure to a portion of the hydraulic system.  A leak in either half of the dual brake system is indicated by the Brake Warning Light, which will turn on when the brake fluid level in the master cylinder has dropped below a specified level.  The light will remain on until the cause is corrected.  If brake failure is indicated, immediate repair is necessary.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  Operation of the Brake Warning Light can be checked by turning the ignition switch from the OFF position to the ON/RUN position.  The light should illuminate for approximately two seconds.  The light should then turn off unless the parking brake is applied or a brake fault is detected.  If the light does not illuminate, have the light inspected by an authorized dealer.  The light also will turn on when the parking brake is applied with the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position.  Note: The light may flash momentarily during sharp cornering maneuvers, which change fluid level conditions.  The vehicle should have service performed, and the brake fluid level checked.  WARNING: Driving a vehicle with the red brake light on is dangerous.  Part of the brake system may have failed.  It will take longer to stop the vehicle.  You could have a collision.  Have the vehicle checked immediately.  Note: This light shows only that the parking brake is applied.  It does not show the degree of brake application.

Brake System Warning Light The red Brake System Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  If the Brake System Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the brake system is not functioning properly and that immediate service is required.  If the Brake System Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.  Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) Warning Light The yellow ABS Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  If the ABS Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the anti-lock portion of the brake system is not functioning and that service is required.  However, the conventional brake system will continue to operate normally if the ABS Warning Light is on.  If the ABS Warning Light is on, the brake system should be serviced as soon as possible to restore the benefits of Anti-Lock Brakes.  If the ABS Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.
Answer: The brake warning light is used to monitor various brake functions, including brake fluid level and parking brake application. It indicates if the parking brake is applied, if the brake fluid level is low, or if there is a problem with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) reservoir. It also signals possible brake hydraulic system malfunctions or issues with the Brake Booster detected by the ABS/Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system. Additionally, it alerts to a leak in the dual brake system or an Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD) failure. The light serves as a warning that immediate service is required if it remains on or comes on while driving, indicating that the brake system is not functioning properly.

GraphRAG Score: 50Question: What's the function of TSC?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Trailer Sway Control (TSC) TSC uses sensors in the vehicle to recognize an excessively swaying trailer and will take the appropriate actions to attempt to stop the sway.  When TSC is functioning, the ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light will flash, the engine power may be reduced, and you may feel the brakes being applied to individual wheels to attempt to stop the trailer from swaying.  TSC is disabled when the ESC system is in the “Partial Off” or “Full Off” modes.  Note: TSC cannot stop all trailers from swaying.  Always use caution when towing a trailer and follow the trailer tongue weight recommendations.  See "⇨trailer towing" for further information.  WARNING: If TSC activates while driving, slow the vehicle down, stop at the nearest safe location, and adjust the trailer load to eliminate trailer sway.
 Trailer Sway Control (TSC) — If Equipped The TSC is a telescoping link that can be installed between the hitch receiver and the trailer tongue.  It typically provides adjustable friction associated with the telescoping motion to dampen any unwanted trailer swaying motions while traveling.
Answer: The function of Trailer Sway Control (TSC) is to recognize an excessively swaying trailer using sensors in the vehicle and take appropriate actions to attempt to stop the sway. This includes flashing the ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light, potentially reducing engine power, and applying brakes to individual wheels.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Traction Grades The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C.These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  WARNING: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.
 For the recommended viscosity and quality grades seeThe Treadwear grade is a comparative rating, based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.  For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100.  The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.  The following tire grading categories were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The specific grade rating assigned by the tire's manufacturer in each category is shown on the sidewall of the tires on your vehicle.  The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.  The grade C corresponds to a level of performance, which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.  The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.  The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.  All passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal safety requirements in addition to these grades.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Fuel that is contaminated by water or dirt can cause severe damage to the engine fuel system.  Proper maintenance of the engine fuel filter and fuel tank is essential see Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  The fuel filler cap is located on the driver's side of the vehicle.  If the fuel filler cap is lost or damaged, be sure the replacement cap is the correct one for this vehicle.
 If you store quantities of fuel, good maintenance of the stored fuel is also essential.  Fuel contaminated with water will promote the growth of “microbes.” These microbes form “slime” that will clog the fuel filtration system and lines.  Drain condensation from the supply tank and change the line filter on a regular basis.  Fuel that is contaminated by water or dirt can cause severe damage to the engine fuel system.  Proper maintenance of the engine fuel filter and fuel tank is essential see Never pour fuel or other flammable liquid into the throttle body air inlet opening in an attempt to start the vehicle.  This could result in flash fire causing serious personal injury.  Do not attempt to push or tow your vehicle to get it started.  Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission cannot be started this way.  Unburned fuel could enter the catalytic converter and once the engine has started, ignite and damage the converter and vehicle.  If the vehicle has a discharged battery, booster cables may be used to obtain a start from a booster battery or the battery in another vehicle.  This type of start can be dangerous if done improperly The use of leaded gasoline is prohibited by Federal law.  Using leaded gasoline can impair engine performance and damage the emissions control system.  An out-of-tune engine, certain fuel or ignition malfunctions can cause the catalytic converter to overheat.  If you notice a pungent burning odor or some light smoke, your engine may be out-of-tune or malfunctioning and may require immediate service.  Contact an authorized dealer for service assistance.  The use of fuel additives, which are now being sold as octane enhancers, is not recommended.  Most of these products contain high concentrations of methanol.  Fuel system damage or vehicle performance problems resulting from the use of such fuels or additives is not the responsibility of The manufacturer and may void or not be covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.

Use of incorrect fuel could result in engine and exhaust system damage If climatized or Number 1 ULSD fuel is not available, and you are operating below 20°F (-6°C), in sustained arctic conditions, Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment (or equivalent) is recommended to avoid gelling (see Fuel Operating Range Chart).  Due to lack of lubricants in alcohol or gasoline, the use of these fuels can cause damage to the fuel system.  Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  If the vehicle is exposed to extreme cold (below 20°F or -7°C), or is required to operate at colder-than-normal conditions for prolonged periods, use climatized Number 2 diesel fuel or dilute the Number 2 diesel fuel with 50% Number 1 diesel fuel.  This will provide better protection from fuel gelling or wax-plugging of the fuel filters.  Use of biodiesel mixture in excess of 20% can negatively impact the fuel filter's ability to separate water from the fuel, resulting in high pressure fuel system corrosion or damage.  In addition, commercially available fuel additives are not necessary for the proper operation of your diesel engine.  For extreme cold conditions, "Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment" is recommended to assist with cold starting.  The presence of water in the fuel system circuit may cause severe damage to the injection system and irregular engine operation.  If the indicator light is illuminated, contact an authorized dealer as soon as possible to bleed the system.  If the previously mentioned indicators come on immediately after refueling, water or AdBlue® (UREA) have probably been poured into the tank: switch the engine off immediately and contact an authorized dealer.
Answer: Damage to the fuel system may be caused by:

1. Fuel contaminated by water or dirt.
2. Using an improper fuel filler cap, which could let impurities into the fuel system.
3. Using leaded gasoline.
4. Using fuel additives with high concentrations of methanol.
5. Using incorrect fuel, such as not using ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.
6. Using biodiesel mixture in excess of 20%, which can affect the fuel filter's ability to separate water from the fuel.
7. Presence of water in the fuel system circuit.
8. Pouring water or AdBlue® (UREA) into the fuel tank.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  It is not possible to know or to predict all of the possible outcomes if your vehicle’s systems are breached.  It may be possible that vehicle systems, including safety related systems, could be impaired or a loss of vehicle control could occur that may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  be possible that vehicle systems, including safety related systems, could be impaired or a loss of vehicle control could occur that may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Access, or allow others to access, information stored in your vehicle systems, including personal information.  When the ACC system is resumed, the driver must ensure that there are no pedestrians, vehicles or objects in the path of the vehicle.  Failure to follow these warnings can result in a collision and death or serious personal injury.
 ROLLOVER WARNING Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.  This vehicle has a higher ground clearance and a higher center of gravity than many passenger vehicles.  It is capable of performing better in a wide variety of off-road applications.  Driven in an unsafe manner, all vehicles can go out of control.  Because of the higher center of gravity, if this vehicle is out of control it may roll over while some other vehicles may not.  Do not attempt sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions that can cause loss of vehicle control.  Failure to operate this vehicle safely may result in a collision, rollover of the vehicle, and severe or fatal injury.  Drive carefully.  Failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury.  In fact, the US government notes that the universal use of existing seat belts could cut the highway death toll by 10,000 or more each year and could reduce disabling injuries by two million annually.  In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.  Always buckle up.
Answer: The driver may lose control of the vehicle if the vehicle's systems are breached, if the ACC system is resumed without ensuring there are no pedestrians, vehicles, or objects in the path, or if the vehicle is driven in an unsafe manner, such as attempting sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions. Additionally, the higher center of gravity of utility vehicles increases the risk of rollover if the vehicle goes out of control.

GraphRAG Score: 56Question: How can I set up the Vehicle Security system?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  To Arm The System Follow these steps to arm the Vehicle Security system: Make sure the vehicle’s ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Perform one of the following methods to lock the vehicle: push the lock button on the interior power door lock switch with the driver and/or passenger door open.  Push the lock button on the exterior Passive Entry door handle with a valid key fob available in the same exterior zone Push the lock button on the key fob.  If any doors are open, close them.  Note: The Vehicle Security system will not arm if you lock the doors using the manual door lock.  VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM — IF EQUIPPED The Vehicle Security system monitors the vehicle doors for unauthorized entry and the ignition switch for unauthorized operation.  When the system is activated, the interior switches for door locks are disabled.  The Vehicle Security system provides both audible and visible signals.  If something triggers the alarm, the Vehicle Security system will provide the following audible and visible signals: the horn will pulse, the parking lights and/or turn signals will flash, and the Vehicle Security Light in the instrument cluster will flash.  SENTRY KEY The Sentry Key Immobilizer system prevents unauthorized vehicle operation by disabling the engine.  The system does not need to be armed or activated.  Operation is automatic, regardless of whether the vehicle is locked or unlocked.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.  After placing the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position, the Vehicle Security Light will turn on for three seconds for a bulb check.  If the light remains on after the bulb check, it indicates that there is a problem with the electronics.  In addition, if the light begins to flash after the bulb check, it indicates that someone attempted to start the engine with an invalid key fob.  In the event that a valid key fob is used to start the engine but there is an issue with the vehicle electronics, the engine will start and shut off after two seconds.  If the Vehicle Security Light turns on during normal vehicle operation (vehicle running for longer than ten seconds), it indicates that there is a fault in the electronics.  Should this occur, have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible by an authorized dealer.  All of the key fobs provided with your new vehicle have been programmed to the vehicle electronics CAUTION: The Sentry Key Immobilizer system is not compatible with some aftermarket remote starting systems.

Note: The Vehicle Security system will not arm if you lock the doors using the manual door lock.  VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM — IF EQUIPPED The Vehicle Security system monitors the vehicle doors for unauthorized entry and the ignition switch for unauthorized operation.  When the system is activated, the interior switches for door locks are disabled.  The Vehicle Security system provides both audible and visible signals.  If something triggers the alarm, the Vehicle Security system will provide the following audible and visible signals: the horn will pulse, the parking lights and/or turn signals will flash, and the Vehicle Security Light in the instrument cluster will flash.  SENTRY KEY The Sentry Key Immobilizer system prevents unauthorized vehicle operation by disabling the engine.  The system does not need to be armed or activated.  Operation is automatic, regardless of whether the vehicle is locked or unlocked.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.  After placing the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position, the Vehicle Security Light will turn on for three seconds for a bulb check.  If the light remains on after the bulb check, it indicates that there is a problem with the electronics.  In addition, if the light begins to flash after the bulb check, it indicates that someone attempted to start the engine with an invalid key fob.  In the event that a valid key fob is used to start the engine but there is an issue with the vehicle electronics, the engine will start and shut off after two seconds.  If the Vehicle Security Light turns on during normal vehicle operation (vehicle running for longer than ten seconds), it indicates that there is a fault in the electronics.  Should this occur, have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible by an authorized dealer.

GraphRAG Score: 57Question: What is the most noticeable noise from the transmission?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.
 Transmission function is monitored electronically for abnormal conditions.  If a condition is detected that could result in transmission damage, Transmission Limp Home mode is activated.  In this mode, the transmission may operate only in certain gears, or may not shift at all.  Vehicle performance may be severely degraded and the engine may stall.  In some situations, the transmission may not re-engage if the engine is turned off and restarted.  The Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) may be illuminated.  A message in the instrument cluster will inform the driver of the more serious conditions, and indicate what actions may be necessary.  It is important to use the proper transmission fluid to ensure optimum transmission performance and life.  Use only manufacturer's specified transmission fluid It is important to maintain the transmission fluid at the correct level using the recommended fluid.  Using a transmission fluid other than manufacturer’s recommended fluid may cause deterioration in transmission shift quality and/or torque converter shudder Continuous driving with the Transmission Temperature Warning Light illuminated will eventually cause severe transmission damage or transmission failure.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause severe clutch damage, transmission damage or failure.  Using a lower gear while operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  This action will also provide better engine braking.  Towing the vehicle, coasting, or driving for any other reason with the transmission in NEUTRAL can cause severe transmission damage.  For Recreational Towing For Towing A Disabled Vehicle When frequent transmission shifting occurs (such as when operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, in hilly terrain, traveling into strong head winds, or while towing a heavy trailer), use the AutoStick shift control to select a lower gear Under these conditions, using a lower gear will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  Racing the engine or spinning the wheels may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  Allow the engine to idle with the transmission in NEUTRAL (N) for at least one minute after every five rocking-motion cycles.  This will minimize overheating and reduce the risk of clutch or transmission failure during prolonged efforts to free a stuck vehicle.  When “rocking” a stuck vehicle by shifting between DRIVE/SECOND gear and REVERSE, do not spin the wheels faster than 15 mph (24 km/h), or drivetrain damage may result.  Revving the engine or spinning the wheels too fast may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  It can also damage the tires.  Do not spin the wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h) while in gear (no transmission shifting occurring).  During cold weather, you may experience increased effort in shifting until the transmission fluid warms up.  This is normal.  Routine fluid and filter changes are not required.  However, change the fluid and filter if the fluid becomes contaminated (with water, etc.  ), or if the transmission is disassembled for any reason.
Answer: The most noticeable noise from the transmission is when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released).

GraphRAG Score: 58Question: what's the function of ABS?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) The ABS provides increased vehicle stability and brake performance under most braking conditions.  The system automatically prevents wheel lock and enhances vehicle control during braking.  The ABS performs a self-check cycle to ensure that the ABS is working properly each time the vehicle is started and driven.  During this self-check, you may hear a slight clicking sound, as well as some related motor noises.  The ABS is activated during braking when the system detects one or more wheels are beginning to lock.  Road conditions such as ice, snow, gravel, bumps, railroad tracks, loose debris, or panic stops may increase the likelihood of ABS activation(s).  You also may experience the following normal characteristics when the abs activates: abs motor noise or clicking sounds (you may continue to hear for a short time after the stop) brake pedal pulsations a slight drop of the brake pedal at the end of the stop note: the abs is designed to function with the original equipment manufacturer (oem) tires.  Modification may result in degraded ABS performance.  WARNING: The ABS contains sophisticated electronic equipment that may be susceptible to interference caused by improperly installed or high output radio transmitting equipment.  This interference can cause possible loss of anti-lock braking capability.  Installation of such equipment should be performed by qualified professionals.  Pumping of the Anti-Lock Brakes will diminish their effectiveness and may lead to a collision.  Pumping makes the stopping distance longer.  Just press firmly on your brake pedal when you need to slow down or stop.  The ABS cannot prevent the natural laws of physics from acting on the vehicle, nor can it increase braking or steering efficiency beyond that afforded by the condition of the vehicle brakes and tires or the traction afforded.  The ABS cannot prevent collisions, including those resulting from excessive speed in turns, following another vehicle too closely, or hydroplaning.  The capabilities of an ABS equipped vehicle must never be exploited in a reckless or dangerous manner that could jeopardize the user’s safety or the safety of others.
 If the ABS light does not turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position, have the brake system inspected by an authorized dealer.  The BAS is designed to optimize the vehicle’s braking capability during emergency braking maneuvers.  The system detects an emergency braking situation by sensing the rate and amount of brake application, and then applies optimum pressure to the brakes.  This can help reduce braking distances.  The BAS complements the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) by applying the brakes very quickly, creating the most efficient braking assistance possible.  To receive the benefit of the system, you must apply continuous braking pressure during the stopping sequence (do not “pump” the brakes).  Do not reduce brake pedal pressure unless braking is no longer desired.  Once the brake pedal is released, the BAS is deactivated.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  The ABS is activated during braking when the system detects one or more wheels are beginning to lock.  Road conditions such as ice, snow, gravel, bumps, railroad tracks, loose debris, or panic stops may increase the likelihood of ABS activation(s).  If the ABS Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the anti-lock portion of the brake system is not functioning and that service is required.  However, the conventional brake system will continue to operate normally if the ABS Warning Light is on.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  The voltmeter may show a gauge fluctuation at various engine temperatures.  This is caused by the glow plug heating system.  The number of cycles and the length of the cycling operation is controlled by the engine control module.  Glow plug heater operation can run for several minutes.  Once the heater operation is complete the voltmeter needle will stabilize.  The temperature gauge shows engine coolant temperature.  Any reading within the normal range indicates that the engine cooling system is operating satisfactorily.  The gauge pointer will likely indicate a higher temperature when driving in hot weather, up mountain grades, or when towing a trailer.  It should not be allowed to exceed the upper limits of the normal operating range.  A hot engine cooling system is dangerous.  You or others could be badly burned by steam or boiling coolant.  It is recommended that you call an authorized dealer for service if your vehicle overheats.  Driving with a hot engine cooling system could damage your vehicle.  If the temperature gauge reads “H” pull over and stop the vehicle.  Idle the vehicle with the air conditioner turned off until the pointer drops back into the normal range.  If the pointer remains on the “H”, turn the engine off immediately and call an authorized dealer for service.  This warning light warns of an overheated engine condition.  If the engine coolant temperature is too high, this indicator will illuminate and a single chime will sound.  If the temperature reaches the upper limit, a continuous chime will sound for four minutes or until the engine is able to cool; whichever comes first.  Engine start-up in very low ambient temperature could result in evident white smoke.  This condition will disappear as the engine warms up.  During extremely cold temperatures (-22°F [-30°C] or below), transmission operation may be modified depending on engine and transmission temperature as well as vehicle speed.  Normal operation will resume once the transmission temperature has risen to a suitable level.

Answer: The engine temperature may fluctuate due to various factors such as driving in hot weather, going up mountain grades, or towing a trailer. These conditions can cause the temperature gauge pointer to indicate a higher temperature. Additionally, the glow plug heating system can cause gauge fluctuations at various engine temperatures, as it operates in cycles controlled by the engine control module. Once the glow plug heater operation is complete, the voltmeter needle will stabilize.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Automatic SOS — If Equipped Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle’s airbags deploy.  Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.
 SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle’s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle’s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle’s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle’s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle’s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle’s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle’s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.

For example, DEF may freeze at temperatures at or below 12°F (-11°C).  The system has been designed to operate in this environment.  Any containers or parts that come into contact with DEF must be DEF compatible (plastic or stainless steel).  Copper, brass, aluminum, iron or non-stainless steel should be avoided as they are subject to corrosion by DEF.  If DEF is spilled, it should be wiped up completely.  The DEF gauge (located on the instrument cluster display) will display the level of DEF remaining in the tank
Answer: The DEF, or Diesel Exhaust Fluid, is a fluid used in vehicles to reduce emissions. It is subject to freezing at temperatures at or below 12°F (-11°C) and must be handled with materials that are DEF compatible, such as plastic or stainless steel, to avoid corrosion. The level of DEF remaining in the tank is displayed on the DEF gauge located on the instrument cluster display.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Under certain conditions, the mobile phone being on in your vehicle can cause erratic or noisy performance from your radio.  This condition may be lessened or eliminated by repositioning the mobile phone within the vehicle.  This condition is not harmful to the radio.  If your radio performance does not satisfactorily improve from repositioning the mobile phone, it is recommended that the volume be turned down or off during mobile phone operation when not using the Uconnect system.  Jamming due to electronic devices or driving next to facilities emitting the same radio frequencies as the TPMS sensors.  Installing some form of aftermarket window tinting that affects radio wave signals.  Lots of snow or ice around the wheels or wheel housings.  Using tire chains on the vehicle.  Using wheels/tires not equipped with TPMS sensors.  The radio unit is acting as the amplifier for audio output from the Auxiliary device.  Therefore, if the volume control on the Auxiliary device is set too low, there will be insufficient audio signal for the radio unit to play the music on the device.
 Once a month or before a long trip: check engine oil level check windshield washer fluid level check the tire pressures and look for unusual wear or damage check the fluid levels of the coolant reservoir, brake master cylinder, and fill as needed check function of all interior and exterior lights once a month or before a long trip: check engine oil level.  Check windshield washer fluid level Check the tire pressures and look for unusual wear or damage, rotate at the first sign of irregular wear.  Check the fluid levels of the coolant reservoir, brake master cylinder, and power steering, and fill as needed.  Check function of all interior and exterior lights What to do when an electrical load reduction action message is present (“battery saver on” or “battery saver mode”) during a trip: reduce power to unnecessary loads if possible: turn off redundant lights (interior or exterior) check what may be plugged in to power outlets +12 volt, 115 volts ac, usb ports check hvac settings (blower, temperature) check the audio settings (volume) after a trip: check if any aftermarket equipment was installed (additional lights, upfitter electrical accessories, audio systems, alarms) and review specifications if any (load and ignition off draw currents).  Evaluate the latest driving cycles (distance, driving time and parking time).  The vehicle should have service performed if the message is still present during consecutive trips and the evaluation of the vehicle and driving pattern did not help to identify the cause.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Gross Trailer Weight (GTW) The GTW is the weight of the trailer plus the weight of all cargo, consumables and equipment (permanent or temporary) loaded in or on the trailer in its "loaded and ready for operation" condition.  The recommended way to measure GTW is to put your fully loaded trailer on a vehicle scale.  The entire weight of the trailer must be supported by the scale.  WARNING: If the gross trailer weight is 2,000 lb (907 kg) or more, it is recommended to use a weight-distributing hitch to ensure stable handling of your vehicle.  If you use a standard weight-carrying hitch, you could lose control of your vehicle and cause a collision.

GraphRAG Score: 69Question: what does the The cartridge block heater do?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  The cartridge block heater clips into the engine block near the water jacket and transfers heat to the coolant.  It requires a 110–115 Volt AC electrical outlet with a grounded, three-wire extension cord.  Its use is recommended for environments that routinely fall below -10°F (-23°C).  It should be used when the vehicle has not been running overnight or longer periods and should be plugged in two hours prior to start.  Its use is required for cold starts with temperatures under -20°F (-28°C).  To ensure reliable starting at these temperatures, use of an externally powered electric engine block heater (available from an authorized dealer) is recommended.  The engine block heater and heater cord are factory installed options.  If your vehicle is not equipped, engine block heaters and heater cords are available from an authorized Mopar® dealer.  Do not exceed the maximum power of 160 W (13 A) at 12 Volts.  If the 160 W (13 A) power rating is exceeded, the fuse protecting the system will need to be replaced.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not insert any other object in the power outlets as this will damage the outlet and blow the fuse.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage not covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Many accessories that can be plugged in draw power from the vehicle's battery, even when not in use (i.e., cellular phones, etc.).  Eventually, if plugged in long enough, the vehicle's battery will discharge sufficiently to degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from starting.  Accessories that draw higher power (i.e., coolers, vacuum cleaners, lights, etc.  ), will degrade the battery even more quickly.  Only use these intermittently and with greater caution.  After the use of high power draw accessories, or long periods of the vehicle not being started (with accessories still plugged in), the vehicle must be driven a sufficient length of time to allow the alternator to recharge the vehicle's battery.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not hang any type of accessory or accessory bracket from the plug.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage Turn off the Fuel Filter Heater, Turn off the HVAC Blower Motor, Close the HVAC Circulation Door Cut off battery power to the: Engine Electric Motor (if equipped) Electric power steering Brake booster Electric park brake Automatic transmission gear selector Horn Front wiper
 Extreme Cold Weather The cartridge block heater clips into the engine block near the water jacket and transfers heat to the coolant.  It requires a 110–115 Volt AC electrical outlet with a grounded, three-wire extension cord.  Its use is recommended for environments that routinely fall below -10°F (-23°C).  It should be used when the vehicle has not been running overnight or longer periods and should be plugged in two hours prior to start.  Its use is required for cold starts with temperatures under -20°F (-28°C).  A 12 Volt heater built into the fuel filter housing aids in preventing fuel gelling.  It is controlled by a built-in thermostat.  A Diesel Pre-Heat system both improves engine starting and reduces the amount of white smoke generated by a warming engine.

Context:  Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ — Passive Entry (If Equipped) The Passive Entry system is a feature that allows you to lock and unlock the vehicle’s door(s) and tailgate without having to push the key fob lock or unlock buttons.  Note: Passive Entry may be programmed on/off through Uconnect Settings The key fob may not be detected by the vehicle Passive Entry system if it is located next to a mobile phone, laptop, or other electronic device; these devices may interfere with the key fob’s wireless signal and prevent the Passive Entry system from locking/unlocking the vehicle.  Passive Entry Unlock initiates Headlight Illumination On Approach (low beams, license plate lamp, parking lights) for whichever duration is set within the Uconnect Settings between 0, 30, 60 or 90 seconds.  Passive Entry Unlock also initiates two flashes of the turn signal lights.  If wearing gloves, if it has been raining/snowing, or there is salt/dirt covering the Passive Entry door handle, the unlock sensitivity can be affected, resulting in a slower response time.  The doors may unlock when water is sprayed on the Passive Entry door handles if the key fob is located outside of the vehicle within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the handle.  If the vehicle is unlocked by Passive Entry and no door is opened within 60 seconds, the vehicle will relock and, if equipped, will arm the Vehicle Security system.

If the vehicle is unlocked by Passive Entry and no door is opened within 60 seconds, the vehicle will relock and, if equipped, will arm the Vehicle Security system.  Frequency Operated Button Integrated Key (FOBIK-Safe) To minimize the possibility of unintentionally locking a Passive Entry key fob inside your vehicle, the Passive Entry system is equipped with an automatic door unlock feature which will function only if the ignition switch is in the OFF position.  FOBIK-Safe only executes in vehicles with Passive Entry.  There are three situations that trigger a FOBIK-Safe search in any Passive Entry vehicle: A lock request is made by a valid Passive Entry key fob while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the Passive Entry door handle while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the door panel switch while the door is open.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  Note: The vehicle will only unlock the doors during a FOBIK-Safe operation when a valid Passive Entry key fob is detected inside the vehicle.  The vehicle will not unlock the doors when any of the following conditions are true: A second valid Passive Entry key fob is detected outside of the vehicle (within 5 ft (1.5 m) of a Passive Entry door handle).  The doors are manually locked using the door lock knobs.  Three attempts are made to lock the doors using the door panel switch, and then the doors are closed.  To Lock The Vehicle’s Doors With one of the vehicle’s Passive Entry key fobs within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the driver or passenger front door handles, pushing the Passive Entry lock button will lock the vehicle doors.  Note: When pushing the door handle lock button, DO NOT grab the door handle.  This could unlock the door(s).  Note: After pushing the door handle button, the driver must wait three seconds before locking or unlocking the doors, using any Passive Entry door handle.  This is done to allow the driver to check if the vehicle is locked by pulling the door handle without the vehicle unlocking.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in “Preventing Inadvertent Locking Of Passive Entry Key Fob In Vehicle” remains active/functional.  The Passive Entry system will not operate if the key fob battery is depleted
Answer: The illuminated entry system will be activated when the Passive Entry Unlock is initiated. This will cause the Headlight Illumination On Approach (low beams, license plate lamp, parking lights) to turn on for the duration set within the Uconnect Settings, which can be 0, 30, 60, or 90 seconds.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Air Bag Warning Light The Air Bag Warning Light will turn on for four to eight seconds as a bulb check when the ignition switch is first placed in the ON/RUN position.  If the light is either not on during starting, stays on, or turns on while driving, have the system inspected at an authorized dealer as soon as possible.  This light will illuminate with a single chime when a fault with the Air Bag Warning Light has been detected, it will stay on until the fault is removed.  If the light comes on intermittently or remains on while driving, have an authorized dealer service the vehicle immediately "⇨air bag warning light" .
 Your vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated Onboard Diagnostic system called OBD II.  This system monitors the performance of the emissions, engine, and transmission control systems.  When these systems are operating properly, your vehicle will provide excellent performance and fuel economy, as well as engine emissions well within current government regulations.  The Engine Check/Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is a part of an Onboard Diagnostic System called OBD II that monitors engine and automatic transmission control systems.  This warning light will illuminate when the ignition is in the ON/RUN position before engine start.  If the bulb does not come on when turning the ignition switch from OFF to ON/RUN, have the condition checked promptly.  Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  If you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following:

GraphRAG Score: 75Question: Any tips for driving downhill?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  If the engine stalls or you lose headway or cannot make it to the top of a steep hill or grade, never attempt to turn around.  To do so may result in tipping and rolling the vehicle, which may result in severe injury.  Always back carefully straight down a hill in REVERSE.  Never back down a hill in NEUTRAL using only the vehicle brakes.  Never drive diagonally across a hill, always drive straight up or down.  Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  Moving from a high gear down to a lower gear is recommended to preserve brakes when driving down steep hills.  In addition, downshifting at the right time provides better acceleration when you desire to resume speed.  Downshift progressively.  Do not skip gears to avoid overspeeding the engine and clutch.
 Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.  Driving Downhill Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  WARNING: Do not descend a steep grade in NEUTRAL.  Use vehicle brakes in conjunction with engine braking.  Descending a grade too fast could cause you to lose control and be seriously injured or killed.  Off-Road Driving Tips
Answer: Before driving down a steep hill, determine if it is too steep for a safe descent by considering surface traction, the grade's steepness, obstacles, whether it is a straight descent, and if there is enough distance at the base to regain control if needed. If confident, ensure the vehicle is in 4L and proceed with caution. Use engine braking to control the descent and apply brakes if necessary, but avoid locking the tires. Do not descend in NEUTRAL; use vehicle brakes with engine braking. Downshift progressively to preserve brakes and avoid overspeeding the engine and clutch.

Answer: When driving downhill, follow these tips for safety:

1. **Assess the Hill**: Before descending, determine if the hill is too steep for a safe descent. Consider surface traction, the steepness of the grade, obstacles, and whether the descent is straight.

2. **Back Down Safely**: If you cannot make it to the top of a steep hill, never attempt to turn around. Instead, back carefully straight down in REVERSE. Do not back down in NEUTRAL using only the vehicle brakes.

3. **Drive Straight**: Always drive straight up or down a hill, never diagonally.

4. **Use 4L**: If you feel confident to proceed, ensure you are in 4L (low gear) and proceed with caution.

5. **Engine Braking**: Allow engine braking to control the descent. Apply brakes if necessary, but avoid locking the tires.

6. **Downshift Properly**: Move from a high gear to a lower gear to preserve brakes. Downshift progressively and do not skip gears to prevent overspeeding the engine and clutch.

7. **Regain Control**: Ensure there is plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast.

To lock all the doors, push the lock button once.  When the doors are unlocked, the turn signals will flash and the illuminated entry system will be activated.  When the doors are locked, the turn signals will flash and the horn will chirp.  Note: All doors can be programmed to unlock on the first push of the unlock button through Uconnect Settings The mechanical flip key can be used to lock or unlock the doors, tailgate, glove compartment, storage compartments (if equipped), and rear seatbacks.
 Your vehicle is equipped with a key fob which supports Passive Entry, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ (if equipped), and Remote Start (if equipped).  The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.

Context:  To Set A Desired Speed Turn the Cruise Control on.  When the vehicle has reached the desired speed, push the SET (+) or SET (-) button and release.  Release the accelerator and the vehicle will operate at the selected speed.  Note: The vehicle should be traveling at a steady speed and on level ground before pushing the SET (+) or SET (-) button.
 To Set A Desired Speed Turn the Cruise Control on.  When the vehicle has reached the desired speed, push the SET (+) or SET (-) button and release.  Release the accelerator and the vehicle will operate at the selected speed.  Note: The vehicle should be traveling at a steady speed and on level ground before pushing the SET (+) or SET (-) button.  To set a desired speed when the vehicle reaches the speed desired, push the set (+) button or the set (-) button and release.  The instrument cluster display will show the set speed.  If acc is set when the vehicle speed is below 20 mph (32 km/h), the set speed will default to 20 mph (32 km/h).  If either system is set when the vehicle speed is above 20 mph (32 km/h), the set speed shall be the current speed of the vehicle.  Note: Fixed Speed Cruise Control can be used without ACC enabled.  To change between the different modes, push the ACC on/off button which turns the ACC and the Fixed Speed Cruise Control off.  Pushing the Fixed Speed Cruise Control on/off button will result in turning on (changing to) Fixed Speed Cruise Control mode.  WARNING: In Fixed Speed Cruise Control mode (ACC not enabled), the system will not react to vehicles ahead.  In addition, the proximity warning does not activate and no alarm will sound even if you are too close to the vehicle ahead since neither the presence of the vehicle ahead nor the vehicle-to-vehicle distance is detected.  Be sure to maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead.  Always be aware which mode is selected.  Note: Fixed Speed Cruise Control cannot be set below 20 mph (32 km/h).  Note: Keeping your foot on the accelerator pedal can cause the vehicle to continue to accelerate beyond the set speed.  If this occurs, the message “DRIVER OVERRIDE” will display in the instrument cluster display.  If you continue to accelerate beyond the set speed while ACC is enabled, the system will not be controlling the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead.  The vehicle speed will only be determined by the position of the accelerator pedal.

GraphRAG Score: 80Question: how to warm up the engine in cold weather?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Engine Warm-Up Avoid full throttle operation when the engine is cold.  When starting a cold engine, bring the engine up to operating speed slowly to allow the oil pressure to stabilize as the engine warms up.  If temperatures are below 32°F (0°C), operate the engine at moderate speeds for five minutes before full loads are applied.
 Engine start-up in very low ambient temperature could result in evident white smoke.  This condition will disappear as the engine warms up.  Warm up the engine before placing it under load.  Do not operate the engine at idle for prolonged periods.  Use the appropriate transmission gear to prevent engine lugging.  Observe vehicle oil pressure and temperature indicators.  Check the coolant and oil levels frequently.  Vary throttle position at highway speeds when carrying or towing significant weight.  If temperatures are below 32°F (0°C), operate the engine at moderate speeds for five minutes before full loads are applied.  Avoid full throttle operation when the engine is cold.  When starting a cold engine, bring the engine up to operating speed slowly to allow the oil pressure to stabilize as the engine warms up.  After full load operation, idle the engine for a few minutes before shutting it down.  This idle period will allow the lubricating oil and coolant to carry excess heat away from the turbocharger.
Answer: To warm up the engine in cold weather, start by bringing the engine up to operating speed slowly to allow the oil pressure to stabilize as the engine warms up. If the temperatures are below 32°F (0°C), operate the engine at moderate speeds for five minutes before applying full loads.

GraphRAG Score: 81Question: how to do the ignition actuated test?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  If you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  Starting with the ignition in the OFF position.  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (instrument cluster will display “ACC”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a third time to return the ignition to the OFF position (instrument cluster will display “OFF”).
 Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: The message will stay active until the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN position.  Starting with the ignition in the OFF position.  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (instrument cluster will display “ACC”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a third time to return the ignition to the OFF position (instrument cluster will display “OFF”).  The START/STOP ignition button has several operating modes that are labeled and will illuminate when in position.  These modes are OFF, ACC, RUN, and START.  Unless reset, this message will continue to display each time you place the ignition in the ON/RUN position.  To turn off the message temporarily, push and release the ok button.  To reset the oil change indicator system (after performing the scheduled maintenance), refer to the following procedure.  To insert an Auxiliary device, gently insert the Auxiliary device cable into the AUX port.  If you insert an Auxiliary device with the ignition and the radio on, the unit will switch to AUX Mode and begin to play.  The system will automatically time out and the ignition will cycle to the OFF position after 30 minutes of inactivity if the ignition is left in the ACC or RUN (engine not running) position and the transmission is in PARK.  For Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ equipped vehicles, the engine will turn off and the ignition will change to ACC position.  After 30 minutes the ignition switches to OFF automatically, unless the driver turns the ignition OFF.  If you must use the accessories (wipers, defrosters, etc.)  while being towed, the ignition must be in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.  The Power Inverter will only turn on if the ignition is in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  Due to built-in overload protection, the power inverter will turn off if the power rating is exceeded.
Answer: To perform the ignition actuated test to check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, follow these steps:

1. Start with the ignition in the OFF position.
2. Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (the instrument cluster will display “ACC”).
3. Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (the instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”).
4. Do not crank or start the engine. If you do, you will have to start the test over.
5. As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, observe the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol, which will come on as part of a normal bulb check.
6. Approximately 15 seconds later, observe the MIL:
   - If the MIL flashes for about 10 seconds and then returns to being fully illuminated, your vehicle's OBD II system is not ready, and you should not proceed to the I/M station.
   - If the MIL does not flash at all and remains fully illuminated, your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, and you can proceed to the I/M station.
7. Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a third time to return the ignition to the OFF position (the instrument cluster will display “OFF”).

Context:  Vehicles sold in Canada are equipped with a headlight switch with an AUTO and ON detent but without an OFF detent.  Headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position.  However, the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) will be activated along with the front and rear marker lights.  The DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged.  For vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.  On some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate, or reduce intensity, on one side of the vehicle (when a turn signal is activated on that side), or on both sides of the vehicle (when the hazard warning lights are activated).  The Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) are in a dedicated position below the headlight assembly.  DRLs are active when the low beams are not on while the vehicle’s transmission is in any position (automatic transmission), or when the vehicle begins to move (manual transmission).

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  If the temperature is below 72°F (24°C) and/or the top has been folded down for a period of time, the top will appear to have shrunk when you raise it, making it difficult to put up.  This is caused by a natural contraction of the vinyl or acrylic materials of the fabric top.  If required for certain off-road uses, the windshield can be folded down.  However, the protection afforded by the windshield is then lost.  If you fold down the windshield, drive slowly and cautiously.  It is recommended that the speed of the vehicle be limited to 10 mph (16 km/h), with low range operation preferred if you are driving off-road with the windshield folded down.  The fold-down windshield on your vehicle is a structural element that can provide protection in some accidents.  The windshield also provides protection against weather, road debris and intrusion of small branches and other objects.  To fold down the rear seat, pull the release strap located on the upper outboard side of the rear seat to release the seat.  The head restraints are folded independently Position the latch plate as close as possible to the anchor point.  At about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) above the latch plate, grab and twist the seat belt webbing 180 degrees to create a fold that begins immediately above the latch plate.  Slide the latch plate upward over the folded webbing.  The folded webbing must enter the slot at the top of the latch plate.  Continue to slide the latch plate up until it clears the folded webbing and the seat belt is no longer twisted.  Be sure that the front seats are fully upright and positioned forward.  This will allow the rear seat to fold down easily.  The center head restraints must be in the lowest position to avoid contact with the center console when folding the seat.  Do not drive your vehicle on-road with the windshield down.  Do not drive your vehicle unless the windshield is securely fastened, either up or down.  Eye protection, such as goggles, should be worn at all times when the windshield is down.  Be sure that you carefully follow the instructions for raising the windshield.  Make sure that the folding windshield, windshield wipers, side bars, and all associated hardware and fasteners are correctly and tightly assembled before driving your vehicle.  Failure to follow these instructions may prevent your vehicle from providing you and your passengers’ protection in some accidents.  If you remove the doors, store them outside the vehicle.  In the event of an accident, a loose door may cause personal injury.

Do not drive your vehicle unless the windshield is securely fastened, either up or down.  Eye protection, such as goggles, should be worn at all times when the windshield is down.  Be sure that you carefully follow the instructions for raising the windshield.  Make sure that the folding windshield, windshield wipers, side bars, and all associated hardware and fasteners are correctly and tightly assembled before driving your vehicle.  Failure to follow these instructions may prevent your vehicle from providing you and your passengers’ protection in some accidents.  If you remove the doors, store them outside the vehicle.  In the event of an accident, a loose door may cause personal injury.  Raise the windshield as soon as the task that required its removal is completed and before you return to on-road driving.  Both you and your passengers should wear seat belts at all times, on-road and off-road, regardless of whether the windshield is raised or folded down.
Answer: The context advises against keeping the top folded down for a long time, as it may appear to have shrunk when you raise it, making it difficult to put up. This is due to the natural contraction of the vinyl or acrylic materials of the fabric top, especially if the temperature is below 72°F (24°C).

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Passengers should not remain in the vehicle when the vehicle is being jacked in position.  Do not attempt to change a tire on the side of the vehicle close to moving traffic.  Pull far enough off the road to avoid the danger of being hit when operating the jack or changing the wheel.  Being under a jacked-up vehicle is dangerous.  The vehicle could slip off the jack and fall on you.  You could be crushed.  Never put any part of your body under a vehicle that is on a jack.  If you need to get under a raised vehicle, take the vehicle to a service center where it can be raised on a lift.  Never start or run the engine while the vehicle is on a jack.  The jack is designed to be used as a tool for changing tires only.  The jack should not be used to lift the vehicle for service purposes.  The vehicle should be jacked on a firm level surface only.  Avoid ice or slippery areas.  Do not attempt to raise the vehicle by jacking on locations other than those indicated.
 If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  Do not attempt to change a tire on the side of the vehicle close to moving traffic.

Avoid ice or slippery areas.  Completely inspect the underbody of your vehicle.  Check tires, body structure, steering, suspension, driveline, and exhaust system for damage.  Inspect the radiator for mud and debris and clean as required.  Check threaded fasteners for looseness, particularly on the chassis, drivetrain components, steering, and suspension.  Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.  If you experience unusual vibration after driving in mud, slush or similar conditions, check the wheels for impacted material.  Impacted material can cause a wheel imbalance and freeing the wheels of it will correct the situation.

GraphRAG Score: 86Question: What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.
 Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver’s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats.
Answer: You should fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears and release it as you lightly press the accelerator pedal. Additionally, ensure that the carpet does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Always securely attach the carpet using the grommets to prevent it from slipping and causing interference with the clutch pedal, which could lead to a loss of vehicle control.

Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the clutch pedal. However, when climbing a steep hill, it is generally important to ensure that the vehicle is in a lower gear with 4L (four-wheel drive, low range) engaged. This implies that you should be mindful of using the clutch pedal to shift into the appropriate gear before starting the climb. Additionally, maintaining momentum is crucial, so avoid excessive use of the clutch pedal that could lead to stalling or loss of traction.

Context:  Towing Tips Before towing, practice turning, stopping and backing the trailer in an area away from heavy traffic.  If using a manual transmission vehicle for trailer towing, all starts must be in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.  TRAILER TOWING In this section you will find safety tips and information on limits to the type of towing you can reasonably do with your vehicle.  Before towing a trailer, carefully review this information to tow your load as efficiently and safely as possible.  To maintain the New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage, follow the requirements and recommendations in this manual concerning vehicles used for trailer towing.

Vehicle damage may occur.  When securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck, do not attach to front or rear suspension components.  Damage to your vehicle may result from improper towing.
 Towing Requirements To promote proper break-in of your new vehicle drivetrain components, the following guidelines are recommended: WARNING: Improper towing can lead to a collision.  Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel.  When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control.  You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision.  When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer.  Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires.  Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer.  Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.  Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.  Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade.  When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle.  Put the tow vehicle transmission in PARK.  Always block or "chock" the trailer wheels.  GCWR must not be exceeded.  Total weight must be distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer such that the following four ratings are not exceeded: gvwr gtw gawr tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized caution: do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles (805 km) the new vehicle is driven.  The engine, axle or other parts could be damaged.  Then, during the first 500 miles (805 km) that a trailer is towed, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and do not make starts at full throttle.  This helps the engine and other parts of the vehicle wear in at the heavier loads.
Answer: When towing a car, you should pay attention to the following:

1. Practice: Before towing, practice turning, stopping, and backing the trailer in an area away from heavy traffic.

2. Manual Transmission: If using a manual transmission vehicle, start in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.

3. Safety Chains: Use safety chains between your vehicle and the trailer, connecting them to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch. Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.

4. Load Security: Ensure the load is secured in the trailer to prevent shifting during travel, which can lead to loss of control.

5. Avoid Overloading: Do not overload your vehicle or trailer, as it can cause loss of control, poor performance, or damage to various vehicle components.

6. Parking: Do not park vehicles with trailers on a grade. Apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle, put the transmission in PARK, and block or "chock" the trailer wheels.

7. Equipment: Use proper towing or lifting equipment to prevent vehicle damage. Do not use sling-type equipment, and do not attach to front or rear suspension components when securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck.

8. Legal Compliance: Observe state and local laws regarding vehicles under tow.

9. Ignition Position: If using accessories while being towed, keep the ignition in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.

10. Break-in Period: Do not tow a trailer during the first 500 miles (805 km) of driving a new vehicle. For the first 500 miles of towing, do not exceed 50 mph (80 km/h) and avoid full-throttle starts.

11. Weight Distribution: Ensure the total weight is distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer so that GVWR, GTW, GAWR, and tongue weight ratings are not exceeded.

12. GCWR: Do not exceed the Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR).

By following these guidelines, you can ensure safe and efficient towing.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  When using a portable battery booster pack, follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and precautions.  Do not use a portable battery booster pack or any other booster source with a system voltage greater than 12 Volts or damage to the battery, starter motor, alternator or electrical system may occur.  If your vehicle has a discharged battery, it can be jump started using a set of jumper cables and a battery in another vehicle, or by using a portable battery booster pack.  Jump starting can be dangerous if done improperly, so please follow the procedures in this section carefully.
 JUMP STARTING If your vehicle has a discharged battery, it can be jump started using a set of jumper cables and a battery in another vehicle, or by using a portable battery booster pack.  Jump starting can be dangerous if done improperly, so please follow the procedures in this section carefully.  WARNING: Do not attempt jump starting if the battery is frozen.  It could rupture or explode and cause personal injury.  CAUTION: Do not use a portable battery booster pack or any other booster source with a system voltage greater than 12 Volts or damage to the battery, starter motor, alternator or electrical system may occur.  Note: When using a portable battery booster pack, follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and precautions.  Maintenance-Free Battery Your vehicle is equipped with a maintenance-free battery.  You will never have to add water, and periodic maintenance is not required.  WARNING: Battery fluid is a corrosive acid solution and can burn or even blind you.  Do not allow battery fluid to contact your eyes, skin, or clothing.  Do not lean over a battery when attaching clamps.  If acid splashes in eyes or on skin, flush the area immediately with large amounts of water Battery gas is flammable and explosive.  Keep flame or sparks away from the battery.  Do not use a booster battery or any other booster source with an output greater than 12 Volts.  Do not allow cable clamps to touch each other.  Battery posts, terminals, and related accessories contain lead and lead compounds.  Wash hands after handling.  Vehicles with the Stop/Start system will be equipped with two batteries.  Both the main and the supplemental batteries must be disconnected to completely de-energize the 12 Volt electrical system.  Serious injury or death could result if you do not disconnect both batteries.  To learn how to properly disconnect, see an authorized dealer.  CAUTION: It is essential when replacing the cables on the battery that the positive cable is attached to the positive post and the negative cable is attached to the negative post.  Battery posts are marked positive (+) and negative (-) and are identified on the battery case.  Cable clamps should be tight on the terminal posts and free of corrosion.  If a “fast charger” is used while the battery is in the vehicle, disconnect both vehicle battery cables before connecting the charger to the battery.  Do not use a “fast charger” to provide starting voltage.  Vehicles with the Stop/Start system will be equipped with two batteries.  Both the main and the supplemental batteries must be disconnected to completely de-energize the 12 Volt electrical system.  If the negative battery cables are not isolated properly it can cause a potential power spike or surge in the system, resulting in damage to essential electrical components.  Disconnecting the jumper cables disconnect the negative (-) end of the jumper cable from the engine ground of the vehicle with the discharged battery.  Disconnect the opposite end of the negative (-) jumper cable from the negative (-) post of the booster battery.  Disconnect the positive (+) end of the jumper cable from the positive (+) post of the booster battery.  Disconnect the opposite end of the positive (+) jumper cable from the positive (+) post of the discharged vehicle.  Reinstall the protective cover over the positive (+) post of the discharged vehicle.  If frequent jump starting is required to start your vehicle you should have the battery and charging system tested at an authorized dealer.  CAUTION: Accessories plugged into the vehicle power outlets draw power from the vehicle’s battery, even when not in use (i.e., cellular devices, etc.).  Eventually, if plugged in long enough without engine operation, the vehicle’s battery will discharge sufficiently to degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from starting.
Answer: Yes, there are specific requirements for the portable battery booster pack:

1. The system voltage of the portable battery booster pack must not be greater than 12 Volts to avoid damage to the battery, starter motor, alternator, or electrical system.
2. The manufacturer's operating instructions and precautions must be followed when using a portable battery booster pack.

Context:  Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.

Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.  Driving Downhill Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  WARNING: Do not descend a steep grade in NEUTRAL.  Use vehicle brakes in conjunction with engine braking.  Descending a grade too fast could cause you to lose control and be seriously injured or killed.  Off-Road Driving Tips

Context:  Basic Voice Commands The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  Push the VR button After the beep, say: “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.  Notice the visual cues that inform you of your Voice Recognition system’s status.
 Helpful hints for using Voice Recognition: Voice commands can be used to operate the Uconnect Phone and to navigate its menu structure.  Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the “Listen” prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying “Call” and then “John Smith” and then “mobile”, the following compound command can be said: “Call John Smith mobile.” For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command “Search for John Smith,” or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: “Search Contacts” and when asked, “John Smith.” Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.  The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  The button on your steering wheel is also used to access the Voice Commands for the Uconnect Voice Command features if your vehicle is equipped.  Did you know: at any time, if you are not sure of what to say or want to learn a voice command, push the vr button and say “ help ”.  The system provides you with a list of commands.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  The Voice Command button on your steering wheel is only used for “barge in” and when you are already in a call or want to make another call.  Reduce background noise.  Wind noise and passenger conversations are examples of noise that may impact recognition.  Speak clearly at a normal pace and volume while facing straight ahead.  Each time you give a Voice Command, first push the VR button, wait until after the beep, then say your Voice Command.  You can interrupt the help message or system prompts by pushing the VR button and saying a Voice Command from the current category.  “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  If you store quantities of fuel, good maintenance of the stored fuel is also essential.  Fuel contaminated with water will promote the growth of “microbes.” These microbes form “slime” that will clog the fuel filtration system and lines.  Drain condensation from the supply tank and change the line filter on a regular basis.  Fuel that is contaminated by water or dirt can cause severe damage to the engine fuel system.  Proper maintenance of the engine fuel filter and fuel tank is essential see Never pour fuel or other flammable liquid into the throttle body air inlet opening in an attempt to start the vehicle.  This could result in flash fire causing serious personal injury.  Do not attempt to push or tow your vehicle to get it started.  Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission cannot be started this way.  Unburned fuel could enter the catalytic converter and once the engine has started, ignite and damage the converter and vehicle.  If the vehicle has a discharged battery, booster cables may be used to obtain a start from a booster battery or the battery in another vehicle.  This type of start can be dangerous if done improperly The use of leaded gasoline is prohibited by Federal law.  Using leaded gasoline can impair engine performance and damage the emissions control system.  An out-of-tune engine, certain fuel or ignition malfunctions can cause the catalytic converter to overheat.  If you notice a pungent burning odor or some light smoke, your engine may be out-of-tune or malfunctioning and may require immediate service.  Contact an authorized dealer for service assistance.  The use of fuel additives, which are now being sold as octane enhancers, is not recommended.  Most of these products contain high concentrations of methanol.  Fuel system damage or vehicle performance problems resulting from the use of such fuels or additives is not the responsibility of The manufacturer and may void or not be covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  The engine requires the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.  Use of incorrect fuel could result in engine and exhaust system damage If climatized or Number 1 ULSD fuel is not available, and you are operating below 20°F (-6°C), in sustained arctic conditions, Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment (or equivalent) is recommended to avoid gelling (see Fuel Operating Range Chart).  Due to lack of lubricants in alcohol or gasoline, the use of these fuels can cause damage to the fuel system.  Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  If the vehicle is exposed to extreme cold (below 20°F or -7°C), or is required to operate at colder-than-normal conditions for prolonged periods, use climatized Number 2 diesel fuel or dilute the Number 2 diesel fuel with 50% Number 1 diesel fuel.  This will provide better protection from fuel gelling or wax-plugging of the fuel filters.  Use of biodiesel mixture in excess of 20% can negatively impact the fuel filter's ability to separate water from the fuel, resulting in high pressure fuel system corrosion or damage.  In addition, commercially available fuel additives are not necessary for the proper operation of your diesel engine.  For extreme cold conditions, "Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment" is recommended to assist with cold starting.  The presence of water in the fuel system circuit may cause severe damage to the injection system and irregular engine operation.  If the indicator light is illuminated, contact an authorized dealer as soon as possible to bleed the system.  If the previously mentioned indicators come on immediately after refueling, water or AdBlue® (UREA) have probably been poured into the tank: switch the engine off immediately and contact an authorized dealer.
 Fuel System Cautions CAUTION: Follow these guidelines to maintain your vehicle’s performance: The use of leaded gasoline is prohibited by Federal law.  Using leaded gasoline can impair engine performance and damage the emissions control system.  An out-of-tune engine, certain fuel or ignition malfunctions can cause the catalytic converter to overheat.  If you notice a pungent burning odor or some light smoke, your engine may be out-of-tune or malfunctioning and may require immediate service.  Contact an authorized dealer for service assistance.

Fuel system damage or vehicle performance problems resulting from the use of such fuels or additives is not the responsibility of The manufacturer and may void or not be covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Note: Intentional tampering with the emissions control system can result in civil penalties being assessed against you.
Answer: To prevent fuel system trouble, you should:

1. Maintain good storage practices for fuel, ensuring it is not contaminated with water or dirt.
2. Regularly drain condensation from the supply tank and change the line filter.
3. Avoid using leaded gasoline, as it is prohibited and can damage the emissions control system.
4. Do not use fuel additives, especially those with high concentrations of methanol, as they can cause damage and are not recommended.
5. Use ultra low sulfur diesel fuel as required by the engine.
6. In extreme cold conditions, use climatized Number 2 diesel fuel or dilute it with 50% Number 1 diesel fuel to prevent gelling.
7. Avoid using biodiesel mixtures in excess of 20% to prevent water separation issues.
8. Ensure the fuel filler cap fits properly to prevent impurities from entering the fuel system.
9. Do not "top off" the fuel tank after filling to avoid spillage and overfilling.
10. If the vehicle is exposed to extreme cold, consider using "Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment" for cold starting assistance.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.

GraphRAG Score: 102Question: what should I do before sending the car to the emission inspection?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  Do not inhale exhaust gases.  They contain carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, which can kill.  Never run the engine in a closed area, such as a garage, and never sit in a parked vehicle with the engine running for an extended period.  If the vehicle is stopped in an open area with the engine running for more than a short period, adjust the ventilation system to force fresh, outside air into the vehicle.  Guard against carbon monoxide with proper maintenance.  Have the exhaust system inspected every time the vehicle is raised.  Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly.  Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open.  Your vehicle is equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to meet the very stringent diesel emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency.
 EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  For states and/or provinces that require an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is functioning and is not on when the engine is running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  Note: if you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: the mil will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn off the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  If your obd ii system is not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.  If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive your vehicle as you normally would in order for your OBD II system to update.  A recheck with the previously mentioned test routine may then indicate that the system is now ready.  Regardless of whether your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, if the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation you should have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station.  The I/M station can fail your vehicle because the MIL is on with the engine running.  Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ Ignition This feature allows the driver to operate the ignition switch with the push of a START/STOP ignition button as long as the key fob is in the passenger compartment.  The START/STOP ignition button has several operating modes that are labeled and will illuminate when in position.  These modes are OFF, ACC, RUN, and START.  The push button ignition can be placed in the following modes: Enhanced Accident Response System Reset Procedure In order to reset the Enhanced Accident Response System functions after an event, the ignition switch must be changed from ignition START or ON/RUN to ignition OFF.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  After an accident, if the vehicle will not start after performing the reset procedure, the vehicle must be towed to an authorized dealer to be inspected and to have the Enhanced Accident Response System reset.
Answer: Before sending the car to the emission inspection, you should:

1. Check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready by performing the ignition actuated test:
   - Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position without cranking or starting the engine.
   - Observe the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol. If it flashes for about 10 seconds and then remains fully illuminated, the OBD II system is not ready. If it does not flash and remains fully illuminated, the system is ready.

2. If the OBD II system is not ready, consider seeing an authorized dealer or repair facility.

3. If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, drive your vehicle normally to allow the OBD II system to update, and then recheck the system readiness.

4. Ensure the MIL is not illuminated during normal vehicle operation, as this could cause the vehicle to fail the inspection.

5. If the MIL is illuminated, have your vehicle serviced before going to the inspection station.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Connected Services SOS FAQs — If Equipped What happens if I accidentally push the SOS Call button on the mirror or overhead console?  You have 10 seconds after pushing the SOS Call button to cancel the call.  To cancel the call, either push the SOS Call button again, or press the Cancel button on the in-vehicle touchscreen.  What type of information is sent when I use the SOS Call button from my vehicle?  Certain vehicle information, such as make and model, is transmitted along with the last known GPS location.  When could I use the SOS Call button?  You can use the SOS Call button to make a call if you or someone else needs emergency assistance.
 SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle’s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle’s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle’s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle’s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle’s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle’s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle’s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.
Answer: If you accidentally push the SOS button, you have 10 seconds to cancel the call. To cancel the call, you can either push the SOS Call button again or press the Cancel button on the in-vehicle touchscreen.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  BED RAIL TIE DOWN SYSTEM — IF EQUIPPED The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  There are two adjustable utility rail cleats on each side of the bed that can be used to assist in securing cargo.  Each utility rail cleat must be tightened down in one of the detents along either utility rail in order to keep cargo properly secured.  To move the utility rail cleat to any position on the utility rail, turn the cleat retainer nut counterclockwise several times.  Then, pull out on the utility rail cleat and slide it to the detent nearest the desired location.  Make sure the utility rail cleat is seated in the detent, and tighten the nut.  To remove the utility rail cleats from the side utility rails, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located at the end of the rail toward the front of the vehicle.  To remove the utility rail cleat from the front utility rail, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located on the left side of the rail.  CAUTION: The maximum load per cleat should not exceed 250 lb (113 kg) and the angle of the load on each cleat should not exceed 45 degrees above horizontal, or damage to the cleat or cleat rail may occur.  Lower Anchors And Tethers For CHildren (LATCH) Your vehicle is equipped with the child restraint anchorage system called LATCH, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren.  The LATCH system has three vehicle anchor points for installing LATCH-equipped child seats.  There are two lower anchorages located at the back of the seat cushion where it meets the seatback and one top tether anchorage located behind the seating position.  These anchorages are used to install LATCH-equipped child seats without using the vehicle’s seat belts.  Some seating positions may have a top tether anchorage but no lower anchorages.  In these seating positions, the seat belt must be used with the top tether anchorage to install the child restraint.  Please see the following table for more information.
 Weight-Distributing Hitch A Weight-Distributing Hitch system works by applying leverage through spring (load) bars.  They are typically used for heavier loads to distribute trailer tongue weight to the tow vehicle's front axle and the trailer axle(s).  When used in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, it provides for a more level ride, offering more consistent steering and brake control thereby enhancing towing safety.  The addition of a friction/hydraulic sway control also dampens sway caused by traffic and crosswinds and contributes positively to tow vehicle and trailer stability.  Trailer sway control and a Weight-Distributing (load equalizing) Hitch are recommended for heavier Tongue Weights (TW) and may be required depending on vehicle and trailer configuration/loading to comply with Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) requirements.  WARNING: An improperly adjusted Weight-Distributing Hitch system may reduce handling, stability, braking performance, and could result in a collision.  Weight-Distributing Hitch systems may not be compatible with surge brake couplers.  Consult with your hitch and trailer manufacturer or a reputable Recreational Vehicle dealer for additional information.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  ROLLOVER WARNING Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.  This vehicle has a higher ground clearance and a higher center of gravity than many passenger vehicles.  It is capable of performing better in a wide variety of off-road applications.  Driven in an unsafe manner, all vehicles can go out of control.  Because of the higher center of gravity, if this vehicle is out of control it may roll over while some other vehicles may not.  Do not attempt sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions that can cause loss of vehicle control.  Failure to operate this vehicle safely may result in a collision, rollover of the vehicle, and severe or fatal injury.  Drive carefully.  Failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury.  In fact, the US government notes that the universal use of existing seat belts could cut the highway death toll by 10,000 or more each year and could reduce disabling injuries by two million annually.  In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.  Always buckle up.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Tachometer Indicates the engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM x 1000).  Do not operate the engine with the tachometer pointer in the red area.  Engine damage will occur.  Temperature Gauge The temperature gauge shows engine coolant temperature.  Any reading within the normal range indicates that the engine cooling system is operating satisfactorily.  The gauge pointer will likely indicate a higher temperature when driving in hot weather, up mountain grades, or when towing a trailer.  It should not be allowed to exceed the upper limits of the normal operating range.  A hot engine cooling system is dangerous.  You or others could be badly burned by steam or boiling coolant.  It is recommended that you call an authorized dealer for service if your vehicle overheats.  Driving with a hot engine cooling system could damage your vehicle.  If the temperature gauge reads “H” pull over and stop the vehicle.  Idle the vehicle with the air conditioner turned off until the pointer drops back into the normal range.

IF YOUR ENGINE OVERHEATS If the vehicle is overheating, it will need to be serviced by an authorized dealer.  Potential signs of vehicle overheating: temperature gauge is at hot (h) strong smell of coolant white smoke coming from engine or exhaust coolant bottle coolant has bubbles present in the event it is observed that the temperature gauge is moving towards or close to the hot (h) position, you can reduce the potential for overheating by taking the appropriate action.  On the highways — slow down.  In city traffic — while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL (N), but do not increase the engine idle speed while preventing vehicle motion with the brakes.  If your Air Conditioner (A/C) is on, turn it off.  The A/C system adds heat to the engine cooling system and turning the A/C off can help remove this heat.  You can also turn the temperature control to maximum heat, the mode control to floor and the blower control to high.  This allows the heater core to act as a supplement to the radiator and aids in removing heat from the engine cooling system.  WARNING: You or others can be badly burned by hot engine coolant (antifreeze) or steam from your radiator.  If you see or hear steam coming from under the hood, do not open the hood until the radiator has had time to cool.  Never try to open a cooling system pressure cap when the radiator or coolant bottle is hot.  CAUTION: Driving with a hot cooling system could damage your vehicle.  If the temperature gauge reads “H,” pull over and stop the vehicle.  Idle the vehicle with the air conditioner turned off until the pointer drops back into the normal range.  If the pointer remains on the “H” and you hear continuous chimes, turn the engine off immediately and call for service.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  For states and/or provinces that require an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is functioning and is not on when the engine is running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  Note: if you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: the mil will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn off the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  If your obd ii system is not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.  If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive your vehicle as you normally would in order for your OBD II system to update.  A recheck with the previously mentioned test routine may then indicate that the system is now ready.  Regardless of whether your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, if the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation you should have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station.  The I/M station can fail your vehicle because the MIL is on with the engine running.  Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ Ignition This feature allows the driver to operate the ignition switch with the push of a START/STOP ignition button as long as the key fob is in the passenger compartment.  The START/STOP ignition button has several operating modes that are labeled and will illuminate when in position.  These modes are OFF, ACC, RUN, and START.  The push button ignition can be placed in the following modes: Enhanced Accident Response System Reset Procedure In order to reset the Enhanced Accident Response System functions after an event, the ignition switch must be changed from ignition START or ON/RUN to ignition OFF.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  After an accident, if the vehicle will not start after performing the reset procedure, the vehicle must be towed to an authorized dealer to be inspected and to have the Enhanced Accident Response System reset.

This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  Prolonged driving with the MIL on could cause further damage to the emission control system.  It could also affect fuel economy and driveability.  The vehicle must be serviced before any emissions tests can be performed.  If the MIL is flashing while the vehicle is running, severe catalytic converter damage and power loss will soon occur.  Immediate service is required.
Answer: Yes, here is a step-by-step instruction to check whether the Onboard Diagnostic (OBD II) system is ready for the emissions inspection:

1. **Cycle the Ignition Switch**: Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. Do not crank or start the engine. If you accidentally start the engine, you will need to start the test over.

2. **Observe the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL)**: As soon as you turn the ignition switch to the ON position, the MIL symbol will come on as part of a normal bulb check.

3. **Wait for 15 Seconds**: Approximately 15 seconds after turning the ignition to the ON position, observe the MIL for one of the following outcomes:

   - **MIL Flashes**: If the MIL flashes for about 10 seconds and then returns to being fully illuminated, this indicates that the OBD II system is not ready. Do not proceed to the inspection and maintenance (I/M) station.

   - **MIL Does Not Flash**: If the MIL does not flash at all and remains fully illuminated, this indicates that the OBD II system is ready. You can proceed to the I/M station.

If the OBD II system is not ready, consider seeing an authorized dealer or repair facility. If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, driving the vehicle normally may update the system. Recheck using the test routine to see if the system is now ready.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  Do not attempt to change a tire on the side of the vehicle close to moving traffic.  Pull far enough off the road to avoid the danger of being hit when operating the jack or changing the wheel.  Being under a jacked-up vehicle is dangerous.  The vehicle could slip off the jack and fall on you.  You could be crushed.  Never put any part of your body under a vehicle that is on a jack.  If you need to get under a raised vehicle, take the vehicle to a service center where it can be raised on a lift.  Never start or run the engine while the vehicle is on a jack.  The jack is designed to be used as a tool for changing tires only.  The jack should not be used to lift the vehicle for service purposes.  The vehicle should be jacked on a firm level surface only.  Avoid ice or slippery areas.  Completely inspect the underbody of your vehicle.  Check tires, body structure, steering, suspension, driveline, and exhaust system for damage.  Inspect the radiator for mud and debris and clean as required.  Check threaded fasteners for looseness, particularly on the chassis, drivetrain components, steering, and suspension.  Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.  If you experience unusual vibration after driving in mud, slush or similar conditions, check the wheels for impacted material.  Impacted material can cause a wheel imbalance and freeing the wheels of it will correct the situation.

Answer: The provided context does not contain specific information about operating a jack or changing a wheel. However, generally, when operating a jack or changing a wheel, you should pay attention to the following:

1. **Safety Precautions**: Ensure the vehicle is on a flat, stable surface and the parking brake is engaged. Use wheel chocks if available.

2. **Correct Jack Placement**: Refer to the vehicle's manual for the correct jack points to avoid damaging the vehicle.

3. **Tools and Equipment**: Use the appropriate tools, such as a lug wrench and jack, and ensure they are in good condition.

4. **Loosening Lug Nuts**: Loosen the lug nuts slightly before jacking up the vehicle, but do not remove them completely until the wheel is off the ground.

5. **Raising the Vehicle**: Carefully raise the vehicle with the jack, ensuring it remains stable.

6. **Removing and Replacing the Wheel**: Once the vehicle is raised, remove the lug nuts and the wheel. Replace it with the spare wheel, and hand-tighten the lug nuts.

7. **Lowering the Vehicle**: Carefully lower the vehicle and then fully tighten the lug nuts in a crisscross pattern to ensure even pressure.

8. **Final Checks**: Ensure all tools and the removed wheel are securely stored before driving.

For specific instructions, always refer to the vehicle's owner manual.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle’s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle’s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle’s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle’s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle’s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle’s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle’s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  With Remote Start, the engine will only run for 15 minutes.  Remote Start can only be used twice.  If an engine fault is present or fuel level is low, the vehicle will start and then shut down in 10 seconds.  The parking lights will turn on and remain on during Remote Start mode.  For security, power window operation is disabled when the vehicle is in the Remote Start mode.  The ignition must be placed in the ON/RUN position before the Remote Start sequence can be repeated for a third cycle.  For information on use with the Remote Start system, see These features will stay on through the duration of Remote Start, or until the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN position.  The climate control settings will change if manually adjusted by the driver while the vehicle is in remote start mode.  This includes turning the climate controls off using the OFF button.
 Description The Remote Vehicle Start feature provides you with the ability to start the engine on your vehicle without the keys and from virtually any distance.  Once started, the preset climate controls in your vehicle can warm up or cool down the interior.  You can also send a command to turn off an engine that has been started using Remote Vehicle Start.  After 15 minutes, if you have not entered your vehicle with the key, the engine will shut off automatically.  This remote function requires your vehicle to be equipped with a factory-installed Remote Start system.  You can set up push notifications every time a command is sent to activate or cancel Remote Start.  REMOTE START — IF EQUIPPED (DIESEL) This system uses the key fob to start the engine conveniently from outside the vehicle while still maintaining security.  The system has a range of approximately 328 ft (100 m).  Remote Start is used to defrost windows in cold weather, and to reach a comfortable climate in all ambient conditions before the driver enters the vehicle.  Note: The vehicle must be equipped with an automatic transmission to be equipped with Remote Start.  Obstructions between the vehicle and the key fob may reduce this range.  The Remote Start system will wait for the Wait To Start yellow telltale to extinguish before cranking the engine This allows time for the engine preheat cycle to heat the cylinder air, and is normal in cold weather.  WARNING: Do not start or run an engine in a closed garage or confined area.  Exhaust gas contains carbon monoxide (CO) which is odorless and colorless.  Carbon monoxide is poisonous and can cause serious injury or death when inhaled.  Keep key fobs away from children.  Operation of the Remote Start system, windows, door locks or other controls could cause serious injury or death.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  The trailcam view can also be activated by pressing the icon on the back up camera view.  The back up camera view can also be activated by pressing the icon on the trailcam view.  If weather conditions are not a factor, the driver should examine the windshield and the camera located on the back side of the inside rearview mirror.  They may require cleaning or removal of an obstruction.  Rear Cross Path Detection (RCP) is not a backup aid system.  It is intended to be used to help a driver detect an oncoming vehicle in a parking lot situation.  Drivers must be careful when backing up, even when using RCP.  Always check carefully behind your vehicle, look behind you, and be sure to check for pedestrians, animals, other vehicles, obstructions, and blind spots before backing up.  Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.
 Whenever the Rear View Camera image is activated through the Back Up Camera button in the Controls menu, and the vehicle speed is greater than, or equal to 8 mph (13 km/h), a display timer for the image is initiated.  The image will continue to be displayed until the display timer exceeds 10 seconds.  Different colored zones indicate the distance to the rear of the vehicle.  The ParkView Rear Back Up Camera allows you to see an on-screen image of the rear surroundings of your vehicle whenever the gear selector is in REVERSE.  The image will be displayed in the touchscreen display along with a caution note to “Check Entire Surroundings” across the top of the screen.  After five seconds this note will disappear.  The ParkView camera is located on the tailgate, above the vehicle license plate.
Answer: Yes, the ParkView Rear Back Up Camera can show an on-screen image of the rear surroundings of the vehicle, which includes the back up path. Different colored zones indicate the distance to the rear of the vehicle, helping the driver see the back up path.

GraphRAG Score: 115Question: What is the brake warning light used for?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Brake Warning Light This warning light monitors various brake functions, including brake fluid level and parking brake application.  If the brake light turns on it may indicate that the parking brake is applied, that the brake fluid level is low, or that there is a problem with the Anti-Lock Brake System reservoir.  If the light remains on when the parking brake has been disengaged, and the fluid level is at the full mark on the master cylinder reservoir, it indicates a possible brake hydraulic system malfunction or that a problem with the Brake Booster has been detected by the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) / Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system.  In this case, the light will remain on until the condition has been corrected.  If the problem is related to the brake booster, the ABS pump will run when applying the brake, and a brake pedal pulsation may be felt during each stop.  The dual brake system provides a reserve braking capacity in the event of a failure to a portion of the hydraulic system.  A leak in either half of the dual brake system is indicated by the Brake Warning Light, which will turn on when the brake fluid level in the master cylinder has dropped below a specified level.  The light will remain on until the cause is corrected.  If brake failure is indicated, immediate repair is necessary.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  Operation of the Brake Warning Light can be checked by turning the ignition switch from the OFF position to the ON/RUN position.  The light should illuminate for approximately two seconds.  The light should then turn off unless the parking brake is applied or a brake fault is detected.  If the light does not illuminate, have the light inspected by an authorized dealer.  The light also will turn on when the parking brake is applied with the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position.  Note: The light may flash momentarily during sharp cornering maneuvers, which change fluid level conditions.  The vehicle should have service performed, and the brake fluid level checked.  WARNING: Driving a vehicle with the red brake light on is dangerous.  Part of the brake system may have failed.  It will take longer to stop the vehicle.  You could have a collision.  Have the vehicle checked immediately.  Note: This light shows only that the parking brake is applied.  It does not show the degree of brake application.

If the light remains on when the parking brake has been disengaged, and the fluid level is at the full mark on the master cylinder reservoir, it indicates a possible brake hydraulic system malfunction or that a problem with the Brake Booster has been detected by the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) / Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system.  In this case, the light will remain on until the condition has been corrected.  If the problem is related to the brake booster, the ABS pump will run when applying the brake, and a brake pedal pulsation may be felt during each stop.  The dual brake system provides a reserve braking capacity in the event of a failure to a portion of the hydraulic system.  A leak in either half of the dual brake system is indicated by the Brake Warning Light, which will turn on when the brake fluid level in the master cylinder has dropped below a specified level.  The light will remain on until the cause is corrected.  If brake failure is indicated, immediate repair is necessary.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  Operation of the Brake Warning Light can be checked by turning the ignition switch from the OFF position to the ON/RUN position.  The light should illuminate for approximately two seconds.  The light should then turn off unless the parking brake is applied or a brake fault is detected.  If the light does not illuminate, have the light inspected by an authorized dealer.  The light also will turn on when the parking brake is applied with the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position.  Note: The light may flash momentarily during sharp cornering maneuvers, which change fluid level conditions.  The vehicle should have service performed, and the brake fluid level checked.  WARNING: Driving a vehicle with the red brake light on is dangerous.  Part of the brake system may have failed.  It will take longer to stop the vehicle.  You could have a collision.  Have the vehicle checked immediately.  Note: This light shows only that the parking brake is applied.  It does not show the degree of brake application.  Brake System Warning Light The red Brake System Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  If the Brake System Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the brake system is not functioning properly and that immediate service is required.  If the Brake System Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.  Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) Warning Light The yellow ABS Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  If the ABS Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the anti-lock portion of the brake system is not functioning and that service is required.  However, the conventional brake system will continue to operate normally if the ABS Warning Light is on.  If the ABS Warning Light is on, the brake system should be serviced as soon as possible to restore the benefits of Anti-Lock Brakes.  If the ABS Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.
Answer: The brake warning light is used to monitor various brake functions, including brake fluid level and parking brake application. It indicates if the parking brake is applied, if the brake fluid level is low, or if there is a problem with the Anti-Lock Brake System reservoir. It also signals a possible brake hydraulic system malfunction or a problem with the Brake Booster detected by the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) / Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system. Additionally, it indicates a leak in either half of the dual brake system or an Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD) failure. The light serves as a warning that immediate service is required if it remains on or comes on while driving, as it suggests that the brake system is not functioning properly.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Trailer Sway Control (TSC) TSC uses sensors in the vehicle to recognize an excessively swaying trailer and will take the appropriate actions to attempt to stop the sway.  When TSC is functioning, the ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light will flash, the engine power may be reduced, and you may feel the brakes being applied to individual wheels to attempt to stop the trailer from swaying.  TSC is disabled when the ESC system is in the “Partial Off” or “Full Off” modes.  Note: TSC cannot stop all trailers from swaying.  Always use caution when towing a trailer and follow the trailer tongue weight recommendations.  See "⇨trailer towing" for further information.  WARNING: If TSC activates while driving, slow the vehicle down, stop at the nearest safe location, and adjust the trailer load to eliminate trailer sway.
 Trailer Sway Control (TSC) — If Equipped The TSC is a telescoping link that can be installed between the hitch receiver and the trailer tongue.  It typically provides adjustable friction associated with the telescoping motion to dampen any unwanted trailer swaying motions while traveling.
Answer: The function of Trailer Sway Control (TSC) is to recognize an excessively swaying trailer using sensors in the vehicle and take appropriate actions to attempt to stop the sway. This includes flashing the ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light, potentially reducing engine power, and applying brakes to individual wheels.

GraphRAG Score: 117Question: What is the highest grade of a tire?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Traction Grades The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C.These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  WARNING: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.
 For the recommended viscosity and quality grades seeThe Treadwear grade is a comparative rating, based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.  For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100.  The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.  The following tire grading categories were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The specific grade rating assigned by the tire's manufacturer in each category is shown on the sidewall of the tires on your vehicle.  The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.  The grade C corresponds to a level of performance, which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.  The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.  The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.  All passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal safety requirements in addition to these grades.  For devices which are not made a favorite, the device priority is determined by the order in which it was paired.  The most recent device paired will have the higher priority.
Answer: The highest grade of a tire is AA.

Proper maintenance of the engine fuel filter and fuel tank is essential see Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  The fuel filler cap is located on the driver's side of the vehicle.  If the fuel filler cap is lost or damaged, be sure the replacement cap is the correct one for this vehicle.

Access, or allow others to access, information stored in your vehicle systems, including personal information.  When the ACC system is resumed, the driver must ensure that there are no pedestrians, vehicles or objects in the path of the vehicle.  Failure to follow these warnings can result in a collision and death or serious personal injury.
 ROLLOVER WARNING Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.  This vehicle has a higher ground clearance and a higher center of gravity than many passenger vehicles.  It is capable of performing better in a wide variety of off-road applications.  Driven in an unsafe manner, all vehicles can go out of control.  Because of the higher center of gravity, if this vehicle is out of control it may roll over while some other vehicles may not.  Do not attempt sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions that can cause loss of vehicle control.  Failure to operate this vehicle safely may result in a collision, rollover of the vehicle, and severe or fatal injury.  Drive carefully.  Failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury.  In fact, the US government notes that the universal use of existing seat belts could cut the highway death toll by 10,000 or more each year and could reduce disabling injuries by two million annually.  In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.  Always buckle up.
Answer: The driver may lose control of the vehicle if the vehicle's systems are breached, if the ACC system is resumed without ensuring the path is clear of pedestrians, vehicles, or objects, or if the vehicle is driven in an unsafe manner such as attempting sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions. Additionally, the higher center of gravity of utility vehicles increases the risk of rollover if the vehicle goes out of control.

GraphRAG Score: 123Question: What is the most noticeable noise from the transmission?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.
 Transmission function is monitored electronically for abnormal conditions.  If a condition is detected that could result in transmission damage, Transmission Limp Home mode is activated.  In this mode, the transmission may operate only in certain gears, or may not shift at all.  Vehicle performance may be severely degraded and the engine may stall.  In some situations, the transmission may not re-engage if the engine is turned off and restarted.  The Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) may be illuminated.  A message in the instrument cluster will inform the driver of the more serious conditions, and indicate what actions may be necessary.  It is important to use the proper transmission fluid to ensure optimum transmission performance and life.  Use only manufacturer's specified transmission fluid It is important to maintain the transmission fluid at the correct level using the recommended fluid.  Using a transmission fluid other than manufacturer’s recommended fluid may cause deterioration in transmission shift quality and/or torque converter shudder Continuous driving with the Transmission Temperature Warning Light illuminated will eventually cause severe transmission damage or transmission failure.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause severe clutch damage, transmission damage or failure.  Using a lower gear while operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  This action will also provide better engine braking.  Towing the vehicle, coasting, or driving for any other reason with the transmission in NEUTRAL can cause severe transmission damage.  For Recreational Towing For Towing A Disabled Vehicle When frequent transmission shifting occurs (such as when operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, in hilly terrain, traveling into strong head winds, or while towing a heavy trailer), use the AutoStick shift control to select a lower gear Under these conditions, using a lower gear will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  Racing the engine or spinning the wheels may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  Allow the engine to idle with the transmission in NEUTRAL (N) for at least one minute after every five rocking-motion cycles.  This will minimize overheating and reduce the risk of clutch or transmission failure during prolonged efforts to free a stuck vehicle.  When “rocking” a stuck vehicle by shifting between DRIVE/SECOND gear and REVERSE, do not spin the wheels faster than 15 mph (24 km/h), or drivetrain damage may result.  Revving the engine or spinning the wheels too fast may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  It can also damage the tires.  Do not spin the wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h) while in gear (no transmission shifting occurring).  During cold weather, you may experience increased effort in shifting until the transmission fluid warms up.  This is normal.  Routine fluid and filter changes are not required.  However, change the fluid and filter if the fluid becomes contaminated (with water, etc.  ), or if the transmission is disassembled for any reason.
Answer: The most noticeable noise from the transmission is when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released).

GraphRAG Score: 124Question: what's the function of ABS?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) The ABS provides increased vehicle stability and brake performance under most braking conditions.  The system automatically prevents wheel lock and enhances vehicle control during braking.  The ABS performs a self-check cycle to ensure that the ABS is working properly each time the vehicle is started and driven.  During this self-check, you may hear a slight clicking sound, as well as some related motor noises.  The ABS is activated during braking when the system detects one or more wheels are beginning to lock.  Road conditions such as ice, snow, gravel, bumps, railroad tracks, loose debris, or panic stops may increase the likelihood of ABS activation(s).  You also may experience the following normal characteristics when the abs activates: abs motor noise or clicking sounds (you may continue to hear for a short time after the stop) brake pedal pulsations a slight drop of the brake pedal at the end of the stop note: the abs is designed to function with the original equipment manufacturer (oem) tires.  Modification may result in degraded ABS performance.  WARNING: The ABS contains sophisticated electronic equipment that may be susceptible to interference caused by improperly installed or high output radio transmitting equipment.  This interference can cause possible loss of anti-lock braking capability.  Installation of such equipment should be performed by qualified professionals.  Pumping of the Anti-Lock Brakes will diminish their effectiveness and may lead to a collision.  Pumping makes the stopping distance longer.  Just press firmly on your brake pedal when you need to slow down or stop.  The ABS cannot prevent the natural laws of physics from acting on the vehicle, nor can it increase braking or steering efficiency beyond that afforded by the condition of the vehicle brakes and tires or the traction afforded.  The ABS cannot prevent collisions, including those resulting from excessive speed in turns, following another vehicle too closely, or hydroplaning.  The capabilities of an ABS equipped vehicle must never be exploited in a reckless or dangerous manner that could jeopardize the user’s safety or the safety of others.
 If the ABS light does not turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position, have the brake system inspected by an authorized dealer.  The BAS is designed to optimize the vehicle’s braking capability during emergency braking maneuvers.  The system detects an emergency braking situation by sensing the rate and amount of brake application, and then applies optimum pressure to the brakes.  This can help reduce braking distances.  The BAS complements the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) by applying the brakes very quickly, creating the most efficient braking assistance possible.  To receive the benefit of the system, you must apply continuous braking pressure during the stopping sequence (do not “pump” the brakes).  Do not reduce brake pedal pressure unless braking is no longer desired.  Once the brake pedal is released, the BAS is deactivated.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  The ABS is activated during braking when the system detects one or more wheels are beginning to lock.  Road conditions such as ice, snow, gravel, bumps, railroad tracks, loose debris, or panic stops may increase the likelihood of ABS activation(s).  If the ABS Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the anti-lock portion of the brake system is not functioning and that service is required.  However, the conventional brake system will continue to operate normally if the ABS Warning Light is on.  The ABS provides increased vehicle stability and brake performance under most braking conditions.  The system automatically prevents wheel lock and enhances vehicle control during braking.  The ABS performs a self-check cycle to ensure that the ABS is working properly each time the vehicle is started and driven.  During this self-check, you may hear a slight clicking sound, as well as some related motor noises.  The ABS contains sophisticated electronic equipment that may be susceptible to interference caused by improperly installed or high output radio transmitting equipment.  This interference can cause possible loss of anti-lock braking capability.  Installation of such equipment should be performed by qualified professionals.  Pumping of the Anti-Lock Brakes will diminish their effectiveness and may lead to a collision.  Pumping makes the stopping distance longer.  Just press firmly on your brake pedal when you need to slow down or stop.  The ABS cannot prevent the natural laws of physics from acting on the vehicle, nor can it increase braking or steering efficiency beyond that afforded by the condition of the vehicle brakes and tires or the traction afforded.  The ABS cannot prevent collisions, including those resulting from excessive speed in turns, following another vehicle too closely, or hydroplaning.  The capabilities of an ABS equipped vehicle must never be exploited in a reckless or dangerous manner that could jeopardize the user’s safety or the safety of others.  The ABS is designed to function with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) tires.  Modification may result in degraded ABS performance.  Your vehicle is equipped with an advanced Electronic Brake Control (EBC) system.  This system includes Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS), Brake Assist System (BAS), Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD), Electronic Roll Mitigation (ERM), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Hill Start Assist (HSA), and Traction Control System (TCS).  These systems work together to enhance both vehicle stability and control in various driving conditions.
Answer: The function of the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) is to provide increased vehicle stability and brake performance under most braking conditions. It automatically prevents wheel lock and enhances vehicle control during braking. The ABS is activated during braking when the system detects that one or more wheels are beginning to lock, helping to maintain steering control and reduce stopping distances.

GraphRAG Score: 126Question: why is the engine temperature fluctuating?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context:  The voltmeter may show a gauge fluctuation at various engine temperatures.  This is caused by the glow plug heating system.  The number of cycles and the length of the cycling operation is controlled by the engine control module.  Glow plug heater operation can run for several minutes.  Once the heater operation is complete the voltmeter needle will stabilize.  The temperature gauge shows engine coolant temperature.  Any reading within the normal range indicates that the engine cooling system is operating satisfactorily.  The gauge pointer will likely indicate a higher temperature when driving in hot weather, up mountain grades, or when towing a trailer.  It should not be allowed to exceed the upper limits of the normal operating range.  A hot engine cooling system is dangerous.  You or others could be badly burned by steam or boiling coolant.  It is recommended that you call an authorized dealer for service if your vehicle overheats.  Driving with a hot engine cooling system could damage your vehicle.  If the temperature gauge reads “H” pull over and stop the vehicle.  Idle the vehicle with the air conditioner turned off until the pointer drops back into the normal range.  If the pointer remains on the “H”, turn the engine off immediately and call an authorized dealer for service.  This warning light warns of an overheated engine condition.  If the engine coolant temperature is too high, this indicator will illuminate and a single chime will sound.  If the temperature reaches the upper limit, a continuous chime will sound for four minutes or until the engine is able to cool; whichever comes first.  Engine start-up in very low ambient temperature could result in evident white smoke.  This condition will disappear as the engine warms up.  During extremely cold temperatures (-22°F [-30°C] or below), transmission operation may be modified depending on engine and transmission temperature as well as vehicle speed.  Normal operation will resume once the transmission temperature has risen to a suitable level.

Answer: The engine temperature may fluctuate due to various factors such as driving in hot weather, going up mountain grades, or towing a trailer. These conditions can cause the temperature gauge pointer to indicate a higher temperature. Additionally, the glow plug heating system can cause gauge fluctuations at various engine temperatures, as the number of cycles and the length of the cycling operation are controlled by the engine control module. Once the glow plug heater operation is complete, the voltmeter needle will stabilize.
