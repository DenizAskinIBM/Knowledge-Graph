============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Léopold Eyharts (born April 28, 1957) is a Brigadier General in the French Air Force, an engineer and ESA astronaut.
The Armée de l'Air (literally, "army of the air") is the name used for the French Air Force in its native language since it was made independent of the Army in 1933. This article deals exclusively with the history of the French air force from its earliest beginnings until its destruction after the occupation of France. French naval aviation, the "Aéronautique Navale" is covered elsewhere.
Answer: The context only provides information about Léopold Eyharts, stating that he is a Brigadier General in the French Air Force. There is no information provided about Ulrich Walter, so based on the given context, we cannot determine if Ulrich Walter was a General in the French Air Force.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Gertrude Stein (February 3, 1874 – July 27, 1946) was an American novelist, poet, playwright, and art collector. Born in the Allegheny West neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and raised in Oakland, California, Stein moved to Paris in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris salon, where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, and Henri Matisse, would meet.
Gertrude Stein wrote "If I Told Him : A Completed Portrait of Picasso” in 1923. It was first published in "Vanity Fair" in 1924 and she subsequently published it in her collection "Portraits and Prayers". This poem was part of a multi-decade intertextual dialogue between Stein and Pablo Picasso. Stein was one of the first to exhibit Picasso’s paintings at her weekly salons at 27 rue de Fleurus. In 1906, Picasso completed a portrait of Stein, and the following year, she wrote her first literary portrait of Picasso, titled “Picasso.” Over a decade later, when the two were no longer working as closely together, she wrote this second portrait, notable for its non-representational style.

It was also sold as the CGL M5 in the United Kingdom by Computer Games Limited, and was reasonably popular in Czechoslovakia, where the M5 stood as one of the first affordable computers available to the general public. Takara also sold models in Japan as the Game M5, and models were also exported to South Korea.
The Interact Home Computer is a rare, very early (1978) American home computer made by "Interact Electronics Inc" of Ann Arbor, Michigan. It sold under the name "interact Model One home computer". The original Ineract Model One computer was designed by Rick Barnich and Tim Anderson at 204 E. Washington in Ann Arbor, then moving to an office in Georgetown Mall on Packard St in Ann Arbor. Interact Electronics Inc was a privately held company that was funded by Hongiman, Miller, Swartz and Cohn...a lawyer firm out of Detroit. The President/Founder of Interact Electronics Inc was Ken Lochner, who was one of the original developers of the BASIC language based out of Dartmouth college. Ken had started Interact Electronics Inc after a successful startup known as ADP Cyphernetics, the original computer time share company in Ann Arbor, now known as ADP Network Services. Only a few thousand Interacts were sold before the company went bankrupt. Most were sold by the liquidator "Protecto Enterprizes" of Barrington, Illinois through mail order sales. The Interact Model One Home Computer debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1978 at a price of $499. The majority of sales were thru Mail Order houses and you could buy it off the shelf at Highland Appliance in the Detroit, MI area and Newman Computer Exchange in Ann Arbor. Probably the most successful application available for the Interace was a program called "Message Center". With it, a store could type in whatever message they wanted to appear scrolling on a TV screen...like Advertisements, or welcoming messages to guests in an office. Although it was mostly a Game machine at the time with games such as Showdown, BlackJack and Chess, there was also BASIC programming where users could create their own programs in the BASIC computer language. Customers began hooking up Interact to control everything from lights in their house, to a Chevrolet Corvette!

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Age of Chance were a British alternative rock-dance crossover band from Leeds, England active from 1985 to 1991. They were perhaps most known for their mutant metallic cover of Prince's "Kiss" which topped the UK Indie Chart in 1986, and peaked at No. 50 in the UK Singles Chart in January the following year. Despite signing for major label Virgin, and being favourites with the UK music press, they never enjoyed a major hit in the UK, although "Don't Get Mad… Get Even" reached No. 8 on the US "Billboard" Hot Dance/Club Play chart.
In probability, and statistics, a multivariate random variable or random vector is a list of mathematical variables each of whose value is unknown, either because the value has not yet occurred or because there is imperfect knowledge of its value. The individual variables in a random vector are grouped together because they are all part of a single mathematical system — often they represent different properties of an individual statistical unit. For example, while a given person has a specific age, height and weight, the representation of these features of "an unspecified person" from within a group would be a random vector. Normally each element of a random vector is a real number.
Answer: Age of Chance and a vector share the concept of being a group or list. Age of Chance was a band, which is a group of musicians, while a vector in probability and statistics is a list of mathematical variables. Both involve the idea of multiple elements being part of a single entity.

GraphRAG Score: 17Question: Which plane has seen more combat, the Northrop F-15 Reporter or the Northrop P-61 Black Widow?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: The Northrop F-15 Reporter (later RF-61) was an American unarmed photographic reconnaissance aircraft. Based on the Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter, it was the last piston-powered photo-reconnaissance aircraft designed and produced for the United States Air Force. Though produced in limited quantities, and with a relatively short service life, the F-15's aerial photographs of the Korean Peninsula would prove vital in 1950, when North Korea invaded the south.
The Northrop P-61 Black Widow, named for the American spider, was the first operational U.S. warplane designed as a night fighter, and the first aircraft designed to use radar. The P-61 had a crew of three: pilot, gunner, and radar operator. It was armed with four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano M2 forward-firing cannons mounted in the lower fuselage, and four .50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns mounted in a remote-controlled dorsal gun turret.
Answer: The Northrop P-61 Black Widow has seen more combat. The P-61 was an operational warplane designed as a night fighter and was armed with cannons and machine guns, indicating its use in combat situations. In contrast, the Northrop F-15 Reporter was an unarmed photographic reconnaissance aircraft, primarily used for taking aerial photographs rather than engaging in combat.

He is also a convicted felon for attempted espionage and fraud against the United States. The FBI arrested him October 19, 2009, charging him with attempted espionage after a sting operation which Nozette's lawyer claims amounted to entrapment. At trial, Nozette admitted attempting to sell U.S. classified information to someone he believed was an Israeli Mossad operative, but was in reality an undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation employee. He pleaded guilty to one charge of attempted espionage and was sentenced, under the terms of a plea bargain, to thirteen years in prison and is now serving time at the Federal Correctional Institution, Terre Haute. The FBI found no evidence that any classified materials were actually released to anyone outside the US Government.

The gameshow featured three children contestants entering a haunted castle in Scotland to assist Professor MacAbre in hunting ghosts before they reach their "death day" and gain superpowers. The show was filmed in Fyvie Castle.
Balloch Castle is an early 19th-century country house situated at the southern tip of Loch Lomond, in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. Balloch was a property of the Lennox family from the 11th century, and the old castle was built in the 13th century.

GraphRAG Score: 37Question: What, known as AAS, is commonly used in bodybuilding?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Anabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone. They are anabolic and increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles, and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of the vocal cords and body hair. The word "anabolic", referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή "anabole", "that which is thrown up, mound." They are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone.
Anabolic/androgenic steroids are drugs that are obtained from the male hormone, testosterone. Anabolic steroids are used for muscle-building and strength gain for cosmetic reasons as well as for performance-enhancement in athletics and bodybuilding. Anabolic steroids work in many ways by increasing protein synthesis in the muscles and by eliminating the catabolic process (the process of breaking down skeletal muscle for energy). It is common for teens and adults to use steroids as they stimulate and encourage muscle growth much more rapidly than natural body building.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: A 200-foot game is an expression used in ice hockey to describe a forward's ability to have strong play at both ends of an ice rink, which is standardized at 200 feet long. Players who can play a 200-foot game are contrasted with players who score a lot of points by avoiding hard forechecking or backchecking, cherry picking their plays perhaps for breakaways, and avoiding fighting for the puck in the corners of the rink, such as Pavel Bure or Brett Hull. Playing a 200-foot game means fighting for each part of the ice, fighting for control of the puck whether it's in one's possession or not, and engaging using your body in traffic. Some examples of players who play or played a 200-foot game include Sidney Crosby, Mike Richards, Marian Hossa, Jonathan Toews, Pavel Datsyuk, Auston Matthews, and Gordie Howe.

Yemoja (Yoruba: "Yemọja" ) is a major water deity from the Yoruba religion. She is an orisha and the mother of all orishas, having given birth to the 14 Yoruba gods and goddesses. She is often syncretized with either Our Lady of Regla in the afrocuban diaspora or various other Virgin Mary figures of the Catholic Church, a practice that emerged during the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Yemoja is motherly and strongly protective, and cares deeply for all her children, comforting them and cleansing them of sorrow. She is said to be able to cure infertility in women, and cowrie shells represent her wealth. She does not easily lose her temper, but when angered she can be quite destructive and violent, as the flood waters of turbulent rivers.

Context: Foxcatcher is a 2014 American true crime sports drama film produced and directed by Bennett Miller. Written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, the film stars Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo. The film's plot is loosely based on the events surrounding multimillionaire Du Pont family heir and wrestling enthusiast John du Pont's 1986 recruitment of 1984 U.S. Olympic gold medalist brothers Mark (Freestyle Wrestling - 82 kg) and Dave Schultz (Freestyle Wrestling - 74 kg) to help coach U.S. wrestlers for participation in national, world, and Olympic competition, and the subsequent murder of Dave by John du Pont in January 1996. Although the film's action is largely set at Foxcatcher Farm, du Pont's now-broken-up 800-acre suburban Philadelphia estate, the majority of the movie was filmed in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

GraphRAG Score: 73Question: What characteristic meaning it's transferable between species, does monkeypox and cowpox virus both share?
============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Cowpox is an infectious disease caused by the cowpox virus. The virus, part of the orthopoxvirus family, is closely related to the "vaccinia" virus. The virus is zoonotic, meaning that it is transferable between species, such as from animal to human. The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairymaids who touched the udders of infected cows and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands. Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease. Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox and the observation that dairymaids were immune from smallpox inspired the first smallpox vaccine, created and administered by English physician Edward Jenner.
Monkeypox virus (MPV) is a double-stranded DNA, zoonotic virus and a species of the genus "Orthopoxvirus" in the family Poxviridae. It is one of the human orthopoxviruses that includes variola (VARV), cowpox (CPX), and vaccinia (VACV) viruses. But it is not a direct ancestor to, nor a direct descendent of, the variola virus which causes smallpox. The monkeypox virus causes a disease that is similar to smallpox, but with a milder rash and lower death rate. Variation in virulence of the virus has been observed in isolates from Central Africa where strains are more virulent than those from Western Africa.

He received a US patent 2,460,707 in February 1949, after a process of 17 years in discussions with the patent office. The main components of the patent were an LC circuit resonator and a set of vacuum power tubes of diode type using uranium and radium power sources and doped germanium semiconductors on the cathodes. It was an early example of doped semiconductors and a forerunner of radioactive power supplies using radioactive isotopes in space research. Moray's device followed other work on nuclear batteries first done in 1913 by Henry Moseley using a radium source.
Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley (23 November 1887 – 10 August 1915) was an English physicist, whose contribution to the science of physics was the justification from physical laws of the previous empirical and chemical concept of the atomic number. This stemmed from his development of Moseley's law in X-ray spectra. Moseley's Law justified many concepts in chemistry by sorting the chemical elements of the periodic table of the elements in a logical order based on their physics.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: "Havisham" is a poem written in 1993 by Carol Ann Duffy. It responds to Charles Dickens' character "Miss Havisham" from his novel "Great Expectations", looking at Havisham's mental and physical state many decades after being left standing at the altar, when the bride-to-be is in her old age. It expresses Havisham's anger at her fiancé and her bitter rage over wedding-day trauma and jilted abandonment. Duffy's use of language is very powerful and passionate. Throughout the poem oxymorons and juxtaposition such as ""Beloved sweetheart bastard"" and ""Love's hate"" portrays the ambivalence and restless uncertainty of the character, while a sexual fantasy reveals both the unrequited love and the passion that remains within Havisham following the wedding, a devastation from which her heart has never recovered.
Dame Carol Ann Duffy (born 23 December 1955) is a Scottish poet and playwright. She is Professor of Contemporary Poetry at Manchester Metropolitan University, and was appointed Britain's Poet Laureate in May 2009.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Jean de Florette (] ) is a 1986 French period drama film directed by Claude Berri, based on a novel by Marcel Pagnol. It is followed by "Manon des Sources". The film takes place in rural Provence, where two local farmers plot to trick a newcomer out of his newly inherited property. The film starred three of France's most prominent actors – Gérard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil, who won a BAFTA award for his performance, and Yves Montand in one of his last roles before his death.
Reassuringly Expensive was the Stella Artois' advertising slogan in the United Kingdom from 1982 until 2007. The 1990s UK television advertising campaigns became known for their distinctive style of imitating European cinema and their leitmotif taken from the score of "Jean de Florette", inspired, in turn, by Giuseppe Verdi's "La forza del destino". The TV campaigns began in 1991 with a series of adverts based on "Jean de Florette", directed by the British duo Anthea Benton and Vaughan Arnell, moving on to other genres including war movies, silent comedy and even surrealism (for which the slogan was changed to "Reassuringly Elephants"). They have used notable movie directors such as Jonathan Glazer, and their aim was to portray the drink in a context of sophisticated European culture.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Ingarö is an island in Värmdö Municipality, Stockholm County. The chief settlement is called Brunn. With an area of 63 km, it is the 16th biggest island in Sweden. Petroglyphs indicate that the island has been inhabited since the Nordic Bronze Age. For most of the 20th century the resident population decreased, while at the same time many vacation homes were built. However, in recent years population has grown as new homes are being built and vacation homes are being converted into permanent homes. Improved communications has made it feasible to commute to Stockholm.
The Nordic Bronze Age (also Northern Bronze Age, or Scandinavian Bronze Age) is a period of Scandinavian prehistory from c. 1700–500 BC. The Bronze Age culture of this era succeeded the Nordic Stone Age culture (Late Neolithic) and was followed by the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The archaeological legacy of the Nordic Bronze Age culture is rich, but the ethnic and linguistic affinities of it are unknown, in the absence of written sources. Some scholars also include sites in what is now Estonia, northern Germany and Pomerania, as part of its cultural sphere.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Georgia Leigh Middleman (born December 27, 1967) is an American country singer. Middleman sang from age ten at the Texas Star Inn in San Antonio, and began writing songs shortly thereafter. She sold recordings of her first song, There's a Rainbow in Everybody's Heart, on her elementary school playground. In her teens, she opened in concert for Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, and collaborated with Dick Wagner at age 17. After graduating from high school, she attended New York University on a theater scholarship, and worked on Off-Broadway shows and as a songwriter.
San Antonio ( Spanish for "Saint Anthony"), officially the City of San Antonio, is the seventh-most populous city in the United States and the second-most populous city in Texas. Founded as a Spanish mission and colonial outpost in 1718, the city became the first chartered civil settlement in Texas in 1731, making it the state's oldest municipality. The city's deep history is contrasted with its rapid growth: it was the fastest growing of the top ten largest cities in the United States from 2000 to 2010, and the second from 1990 to 2000. Straddling the regional divide between South and Central Texas, San Antonio anchors the southwestern corner of an urban megaregion colloquially known as the "Texas Triangle".

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: Eva Hayman (born 1924 in Czechoslovakia) was a Holocaust survivor. When she was only 15, she was sent on a train to Britain with her sister Vera as part of the kindertransport movement, which saved many Jewish children and was organized by Nicholas Winton. Hayman said that her childhood ended the day she boarded the train and she saw children that were torn out of their parents arms. Many older siblings had to become a parent to their younger sisters or brothers. Eva and Vera spent most of the war in Liverpool, Hastings, Monmouth, and Poole. It eventually became impossible to write letters to their parents, so Hayman began writing a diary that was later published as a book called "By the Moon and the Stars".
The Holocaust, also referred to as the Shoah, was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its World War II collaborators killed some six million European Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and constituted about two-thirds of the nine million Jews in Continental Europe. A broader definition of the Holocaust includes non-Jewish victims such as the Roma, ethnic Poles, other Slavic ethnic groups, and the disabled and mentally ill.

Context: Stitch's Great Escape! is a Tomorrowland attraction at the Magic Kingdom theme park within the Walt Disney World Resort. It is a "theater-in-the-round" experience starring the title alien from Walt Disney Animation Studios' 2002 film "Lilo & Stitch". It opened November 16, 2004 and is the fourth attraction to occupy the site in Tomorrowland. Many of the animators who worked on "Lilo & Stitch" partnered with Walt Disney Imagineering for Stitch's Great Escape! The attraction is a replacement of The ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter, which formerly occupied the building the attraction is housed in. On September 21, 2016, it was announced that the attraction would be switching from a daily operated attraction to a seasonally operated one, depending on attendance, starting October 2, 2016.
Snow White's Scary Adventures is a dark ride at the Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park (Paris) theme parks, and formerly the Magic Kingdom theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort.

Context: The Wind in the Willows is a children's novel by Kenneth Grahame, first published in 1908. Alternately slow moving and fast paced, it focuses on four anthropomorphised animals in a pastoral version of Edwardian England. The novel is notable for its mixture of mysticism, adventure, morality and camaraderie, and celebrated for its evocation of the nature of the Thames Valley.
The Wind in the Willows is a TV series that was originally broadcast between 1984 and 1987, based on characters from Kenneth Grahame's classic story "The Wind in the Willows" and following the 1983 film "The Wind in the Willows". It was made by animation company Cosgrove Hall for Thames Television and shown on the ITV network. An hour-long feature, "A Tale Of Two Toads", was broadcast in 1989, and a fifth season of 13 episodes was shown in 1990 under the title "Oh!

Context: The Reichstadt agreement was an agreement made between Austria-Hungary and Russia in July 1876, who were at that time in an alliance with each other and Germany in the League of the Three Emperors, or "Dreikaiserbund". Present were the Russian and Austro-Hungarian emperors together with their foreign ministers, Prince Gorchakov of Russia and Count Andrassy of Austria-Hungary. The closed meeting took place on July 8 in the Bohemian city of Reichstadt (now Zákupy). They agreed on a common approach to the solution of the Eastern question, due to the unrest in the Ottoman Empire and the interests of the two major powers in the Balkans. They discussed the likely Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, its possible outcomes and what should happen under each scenario.
The Three Caesars' Alliance or League of the Three Emperors (German: "Dreikaiserabkommen" , Russian: Союз трёх императоров ) was an alliance between the German Empire, the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary, from 1873 to 1887. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck took full charge of German foreign policy from 1870 to his dismissal in 1890. His goal was a peaceful Europe, based on the balance of power. Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria, France and Russia would crush Germany. If two of them were allied, then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands. The solution was to ally with two of the three. In 1873 he formed the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance of the Kaiser of Germany, the Tsar of Russia, and the Kaiser of Austria-Hungary. Together they would control Eastern Europe, making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept in control. It aimed at neutralizing the rivalry between Germany’s two neighbors by an agreement over their respective spheres of influence in the Balkans and at isolating Germany’s enemy, France. The Balkans posed a more serious issue, and Bismarck's solution was to give Austria predominance in the western areas, and Russia in the eastern areas.

The Allied invasion of Germany started with the Western Allies crossing the Rhine River in March 1945 before fanning out and overrunning all of western Germany from the Baltic in the north to Austria in the south before the Germans surrendered on 8 May 1945. This is known as the "Central Europe Campaign" in United States military histories.
The Battle of Fredericksburg was fought December 11–15, 1862, in and around Fredericksburg, Virginia, between General Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General Ambrose Burnside, as part of the American Civil War. The Union Army's futile frontal attacks on December 13 against entrenched Confederate defenders on the heights behind the city are remembered as one of the most one-sided battles of the war, with Union casualties more than three times as heavy as those suffered by the Confederates.

============================TRADITIONAL RAG============================
Context: The Riom Trial (French: "Procès de Riom" ; 19 February 1942 – 21 May 1943) was an attempt by the Vichy France regime, headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain, to prove that the leaders of the French Third Republic (1870–1940) had been responsible for France's defeat by Germany in 1940. The trial was held in the city of Riom in central France, and had mainly political aims – namely to project the responsibility of defeat onto the leaders of the left-wing Popular Front government that had been elected 3 May 1936.
