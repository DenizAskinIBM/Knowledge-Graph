Um.So what does everyone want to work on?\\nShridhar Patel   3:19So I can go first.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   3:20Of yeah, go.\\nChung Zheng   3:21No. Yeah.\\nShridhar Patel   3:21Um, today I will basically try to set set up the front end and set up the UI it.It won't be anything fancy.It will just be simple pages for now, but I'll just try to set it up so that I can start building.I'll maybe start building today, but I can guarantee that because my other engagement is also picking up where in the build phase for that as well.But yes, I will definitely set it up today.\\nDean Sacoransky   3:53Awesome.\\nDeniz Askin   3:55Um, I love to work on.Basically getting the transcription from teams and then.Like basically the.The the workflow for querying the transcript sounds really interesting to me.So if you want, I can just name the item that was assigned to me in teams agent as I'm something like.Transcript, Q&A or transcript chat bot.\\nDean Sacoransky   4:33Sure.\\nDeniz Askin   4:33Expert querying uh.One of those.Yeah, I called it.Transcript querying for now in teams agent.That's what I'm happy to work on that.\\nDean Sacoransky   4:48Awesome.\\nSara Golestaneh   4:53Sorry, I think I think I don't have the invite for the Monday yet.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   4:53I.\\nSara Golestaneh   4:57I don't have access to this sport.\\nDean Sacoransky   5:02He was posted in the Slack channel.If you click on the on that link or you able to get access.\\nSara Golestaneh   5:10Let me try.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   5:23No.\\nSara Golestaneh   5:24OK, OK.Can access it, sorry.\\nDean Sacoransky   5:28And also um, so who else?Reyhaneh, what are you thinking?What do you want to work on?\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   5:35Yeah, I was thinking I can work on that.So given a list of action items, I can work on the JIRA agent to create the draft tickets.\\nDean Sacoransky   5:45Awesome.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   5:51My side I need to catch up with you guys and on the overall.\\nDean Sacoransky   5:54Yeah.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   5:57A goal, but I think we would need a potential, I don't know, maybe you all did that did that, but an overall planning agent, I think it's orchestrator, right that would.\\nDean Sacoransky   6:07Right, yeah.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   6:08So I think we need to think all the teams with that to make sure we are writing the the right sub agent.\\nDean Sacoransky   6:15Yeah, absolutely.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   6:17That, yeah.\\nSara Golestaneh   6:20And also if if they are planning to use Watson's orchestra like we do, we want direct integration with all of these or should we, like think about the the skills that are available in orchestra to integrate, for example, the girl outlook teams instead?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   6:20So yeah.\\nDean Sacoransky   6:41What do you think?But is it?\\nSara Golestaneh   6:45If.\\nDean Sacoransky   6:46Yeah.What's your?What's your take on that?\\nSara Golestaneh   6:48Yeah, if you want to use orchestrate, we can.We can use the skills, but I'm not sure how reliable those are.We should try them out.Um, because we had some problem like connecting to for example Outlook.In the previous engagement, but.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   7:07On the cluster, the C cluster it walk, it works, but the we need to test thing.\\nDean Sacoransky   7:15OK.Sarah, would you be willing to look into like the orchestrated side of things?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   7:16Dear.\\nSara Golestaneh   7:22Yeah, yeah.Um.And do we have like test accounts for JIRA or outlook that we can use? Yeah.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   7:33Yeah, yeah, yeah.OK, I can send you a a link of testicles yet and it's in that in the chat.\\nSara Golestaneh   7:39OK.Yeah.Thank you.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   7:42Yeah, and yeah, so.\\nChung Zheng   7:47Ohk can I help out with orchestrate stuff too?I wanna look around on that.\\nDean Sacoransky   7:57Absolutely.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   7:57Yeah, for sure.Do you have access to an orchestrated cluster?That's we.You you might, you might need A to get an access to you.\\nChung Zheng   8:04Uh.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   8:09To us he account or we can give you the API keys, but we if you don't have access to logging you won't be able to to get to the wire.\\nChung Zheng   8:18OK.Uh, is it that DDL like orchestrate 1?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   8:25Let me.Uh, yeah, yeah.The let me just so this is the credentials and just sending the list and yeah ohkay straight it's.Yeah, DL, what's an orchestrate?IBM, if you log into that, you should see the list of crystal you have access to.\\nChung Zheng   8:41Yeah, I.\\nDean Sacoransky   8:46Hmm.\\nChung Zheng   8:46Yeah, I got access to that for something else.RBC.But can I see the one you guys are gonna make like a project or something is just asked us in the cluster number.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   8:53Hmm.Ah, yeah, yes.Uh.So I.\\nChung Zheng   9:04Do I need to be invited to like your orchestra project?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   9:06Yeah, you need to ask a I personally, I asked to Anita that she there are we need to agree on which one we are going to use so that we all have access to the same one because there are several C cluster.\\nChung Zheng   9:20OK.Like, should we make money for this asset?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   9:21Uh.There is this.There is this one that that is the one I have access to with Sarah, I think.But.\\nChung Zheng   9:36Hmm.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   9:37Because check if there is some.Oh, maybe the two axis T2 since I was mad admin.OK, this one I will.Let me be something that count, that's.\\nDean Sacoransky   9:56I also really want to learn orchestrate, so I'll probably reach out at like connect with you guys to get involved with that and.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   10:08So just to confirm, the goal is to, yeah, we will have a meeting later to catch up, but the goal is to call orchestrate through as a tool, right in.\\nChung Zheng   10:16Yeah.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   10:17OK.So yeah, I think it's a cross across several agents.We need that to be set in place, right?We decide to use a orchestrate for Outlook, Jara and it's a OK so OK.\\nDean Sacoransky   10:28Right.Um, OK, so right now it seems like Rayhan is is gonna be involved with the jeera.Denise with teams, I could take outlook.JHS is interested in the orchestrator by orchestrator.I meant like planet the plan and execute type of thing, not Watson orchestrate um.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   10:52Yeah.Yeah. Yeah, yeah.Yeah.So like the distribute the task subtask to subagents to achieve A and an objective right, OK.\\nDean Sacoransky   10:57Right.Exactly.Exactly.Um.Sarah said.Like you'll take up some of the Watson X orchestrate integration.Are you also interested in like doing one of the sub agents or like if anyone is just just feel free to to step up and like take on stuff.\\nSara Golestaneh   11:26Yeah, I'm OK with any of them, yeah.\\nDean Sacoransky   11:26Yeah, this is.OK.So I'll let you decide.Um Chung, what do you what do you thinking?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   11:33No.\\nChung Zheng   11:36Like what?I'm going to take on.\\nDean Sacoransky   11:38Yeah.Like, what do you wanna do?This is a like meant to be a good learning experience.\\nChung Zheng   11:40Um.\\nDean Sacoransky   11:42So whatever everyone wants to do.Just, yeah, speak up on it.\\nChung Zheng   11:47Yeah.Uh, I kinda wanna help out with the orchestrate agent as well.Like I wanna.I'll support on front end stuff for sure and then maybe like pick up some orchestrate stuff on the side.Um like now Watson neck?Or should we just orchestrator in general?Because I'm don't wanna learn like how to integrate various agents.\\nDean Sacoransky   12:12Yeah.And then Jen, I see you've already populated some something.\\nJennifer Shintani   12:21Yeah, I self assigned for the UI stuff and I booked that meeting later.So we'll we'll go through it and I assume will probably be some changes.So we'll do us like in a duration this week.\\nDean Sacoransky   12:34Right.Sounds good.So I guess everyone for for like the agent or work stream you're working on, just populate tickets and we'll start chipping away.And like I think the end goal, the output is for each agent we have a a graph like similar to to this repo that I that we've looked at a couple times like each sub agent is just a like a Python class, but it's a langra functional lane graph.So that would be the eventual end goal or deliverable for each savage and that way we all have, we all have the experience building our own like agent and then it will be orchestrated by the orchestrator stream.We could try it out and see how it works and be agile.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   13:33Yeah.\\nDean Sacoransky   13:39Um, what do you guys think?\\nJennifer Shintani   13:39And I'm just adding a task.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   13:39You.\\nJennifer Shintani   13:42I'm just adding a task if everyone wants to add their like Monday board items this week, so we can just track everything like by the end of the day today and then we could like help to divvy up work.\\nDean Sacoransky   13:55Awesome.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   13:58Yeah.\\nDean Sacoransky   13:59What do you guys think of that plan or do?Or are there other ideas like please?Yeah share.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   14:07I think maybe we should have an objective for like we have two weeks like maybe.Some intermediate objective I don't know.\\nDean Sacoransky   14:15Hmm.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   14:18At the end of the day, the week we can.Have a proper planning or executive staff individually, or if subgraph I don't know, maybe we should have a stomach from the concrete.Said objective on the ballot.\\nDean Sacoransky   14:39Hmm, what do you do?You have any eye suggestions on what that could be?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   14:45Yeah, I think I need to be a bit more to speed on the all the what you have defined letter and.Yeah.So each subregion maybe have being able to call them separately and do the the with a some mock task.\\nDean Sacoransky   15:04Hmm.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   15:04And then I have a proper planning.Uh.Defined for first week, then we could integrate that in the second week.Thing with the.\\nDean Sacoransky   15:17Yeah, I agree.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   15:19Oh, are we creative?Food Planning Agent first week where we mock every subtask and.And then we integrate with the sub agent for the second week.\\nDean Sacoransky   15:35Yeah, I wonder what is like the best practice?Which way to go first?Whether you start with the sub agents or the planning agent first.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   15:46Hmm.Oh, I think we.We need to agree on the end goal of each one.\\nDean Sacoransky   15:56Hmm.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   15:58It's that's probably already done.OK.\\nDean Sacoransky   16:04Should we book a maybe 30 minutes to discuss this?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   16:09Yeah.\\nDean Sacoransky   16:09As I told him?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   16:09I think the overall overall integration between between teams and between the the main orchestrator and that could be a good idea.Just so that we know what to deliver.\\nDean Sacoransky   16:20Hmm.OK and.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   16:25Yeah, just.Yeah, let's connect together just to just to you can I can catch up and then we can have a meeting.Maybe it's already you already planned that, so I don't want to interfering.\\nDean Sacoransky   16:35No, I mean, no, no, we have no plan, no interference.OK, sounds good.So we'll catch up and then hopefully book something later today to discuss all like that integration stuff.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   16:51Yeah. OK.Poop.\\nJennifer Shintani   16:53Do you?Are you gonna book that meeting?\\nDean Sacoransky   16:56Yes, I'll book it.\\nJennifer Shintani   16:58OK, I probably don't need to be there, so don't let my calendar walk you guys.\\nDean Sacoransky   17:02OK.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   17:03OK.\\nJennifer Shintani   17:03Um, I was wondering, like I know we don't have a client, so we don't need to do a formal playback, but do we wanna just like have 1/2 hour on Friday?Maybe just to talk about the progress we made for the week and plan for the following week.\\nShridhar Patel   17:22I think that would be a good idea.\\nDean Sacoransky   17:22Yeah.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   17:24Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\nJennifer Shintani   17:25Yeah.Yeah, like we don't need to make a presentation or anything, but and maybe we'll invite Nassim if she has feedback and stuff like that.OK, let me book that.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   17:35Yeah.\\nDean Sacoransky   18:01Alright, sounds good.\\nChung Zheng   18:07Oh, oh, do we have a Techzone instance reserve.Do we need one?Like, what's the next I or anything?\\nDean Sacoransky   18:16And I think everyone just create like a one of those self study accounts and get API keys and.\\nChung Zheng   18:28Ohhhhh.\\nDean Sacoransky   18:29Or we do it that way.\\nSara Golestaneh   18:31I think it's not a bad idea to have one text on for what's next that I cause, like for transcription and other things we will need to.\\nChung Zheng   18:40They'll yeah.Like if we need to collaborate, we should, OK?Can someone reserve one?\\nDean Sacoransky   18:46OK, this is how do we go about doing that?\\nChung Zheng   18:53Like a reserve attacks on instance for what's next dot AI.\\nDean Sacoransky   18:56Yeah, without an opportunity ID.Is it possible to do that?\\nChung Zheng   19:00Yeah.\\nDean Sacoransky   19:01OK.Could you do that?\\nChung Zheng   19:04We OK?Yeah, I can do that.Uh, yeah.\\nSara Golestaneh   19:11What's the maximum?\\nShridhar Patel   19:11Also.\\nChung Zheng   19:14So.Yeah, I'm not sure I have.Also wondering if, like Nassim can get us an opportunity ID cause she made an entry and IC, so I'll go take a look.If there's a opportunity idea on that.\\nShridhar Patel   19:29And Chung, if you're creating like a group of different instances, we also need one code engine.So if you create it, we could.\\nChung Zheng   19:38Oh yeah, yeah.\\nShridhar Patel   19:39Yeah, create it on that instance.\\nChung Zheng   19:42OK, um, what are you?Yeah, for like the Watson X style.Like, what do we need?Just start dot AI.Do we need discovery?Do we need uh?\\nSara Golestaneh   19:52I think it's not bad to have what's the next discovery because I'm not sure.Like how long the transcripts will be.But it might be that we have to like, yeah, restore it in a picture database.\\nChung Zheng   20:00OK.OK, I'll take a look at what, yeah, what environments there are.Peggy, let me know if you guys like need anything.OK.I'll.I'll take that.I'll take the environment setup or reservation.\\nDean Sacoransky   20:25Awesome.OK.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   20:34You.\\nDean Sacoransky   20:35Anything else?Or are we good to to break?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   20:40I think we're good.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   20:43I just question.\\nJennifer Shintani   20:44Is there?\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   20:47A screen.\\nJennifer Shintani   20:50Go ahead.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   20:51I just have one question with regards to the test accounts for Outlook and angira.Should we use?Should we create global like creating an account or or we should use like a shared IBM account for JIRA and outlook?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   21:09So for Outlook, I think in the link I sent there is an outlook account or it doesn't work.Let me check there is an account that we can use.And for the for the giraffe, I was asked to do a demo of Girard last week on this.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   21:19Oh, I see.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   21:25Castrate and with the with the test account it didn't work.It could not create a I don't know why, but it could not create a an issue.Maybe it was something I did wrong.I could pull the so maybe we have to use the IBM Tyra for that and there is also a the description in this box document on how to use the IP and gyro.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   21:46Oh, thank you.Can you share the document?I'm.I'm not sure that I can create an account with IBM.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   21:49Yeah, it.Yeah.Let me let me share that I'm just trying to find because the box link I sent doesn't.It's not the right one.Sorry.Let me just, yeah, set party.OK so I'm just posting an ad box, not let me know if you have access.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   22:17Yes, thank you.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   22:19So number six and number six, there is a username and password for Outlook.So when you connect on orchestrate you can give admin user name, password with those those account.And for JIRA, I think there is an instruction.There is a link for instruction on how to create an API key for the IBM gyro.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   22:34The.Yes.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   22:39So try your free account first, but if it doesn't work with orchestrate and if you encounter the same issue as me, maybe you will have to consider using the IBM driver.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   22:50Yeah, for sure.By feet, can't you mean just like going and the personal account?\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   22:56Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   22:57Oh, I see for sure.Thank you.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   23:01That's this is the out of the book schooled in orchestrate, to integrate with a with a free account for the IBM account.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   23:04I.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   23:08I think in this procedure that describe a customer open API for that, but yeah, yeah you can test it.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   23:15What? Yes.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   23:15It's part of the of the.Asking.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   23:19Show.\\nJennifer Shintani   23:25I was wondering for all the transcripts of the meetings, is it do you want me to put them all into a box folder?Is that the most convenient place for everyone to access them?Where is there somewhere else you guys would prefer me to or share them with you?\\nDean Sacoransky   23:45That's good with me.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   23:46Yeah.Yeah, that's called there.\\nJennifer Shintani   23:47OK, I'll set that up.\\nChung Zheng   23:47Xbox sounds good.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   23:49Thank you.\\nJennifer Shintani   23:57OK, I think that was all.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   24:02Yeah.\\nJennifer Shintani   24:03Thanks everyone.Have a good day.\\nDean Sacoransky   24:04Thank you, but.\\nJacques-Sylvain Lecointre   24:04Thank you.\\nChung Zheng   24:05Thanks.\\nReyhaneh Ghoreishiamiri   24:05Thank you.\\nShridhar Patel   24:07Thanks team.\\nJennifer Shintani stopped transcription"
