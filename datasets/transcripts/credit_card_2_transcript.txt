Agent: Thank you for calling MD Bank. My name is Sarah, and I’ll be assisting you today. May I have your full name to locate your account?

Customer: Sure, it’s Daniel Roberts.

Agent: Thank you, Mr. Roberts. For security purposes, could you confirm your date of birth and the last four digits of your MD Bank credit card?

Customer: My date of birth is May 14, 1987, and the last four digits are 5634.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. How can I assist you today?

Customer: I recently received my new credit card, and everything seemed fine at first. But I noticed a $50 charge on my statement that I don’t recognize. I just wanted to check what it’s about.

Agent: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Roberts. Let me take a look at your account to investigate the charge. Could you let me know the date of the transaction and the merchant listed on the statement?

Customer: Sure, it’s dated December 10, and the merchant name is something like “EZ-Shop Online.” I don’t recall making any purchases from them.

Agent: Thank you for that information. Let me pull up the details... Alright, I see the $50 charge. Can you confirm that you didn’t authorize this transaction or make any purchases from this merchant?

Customer: No, I didn’t authorize it. I’m sure of that.

Agent: Thank you for confirming. It sounds like this may be a fraudulent charge. I’ll walk you through the next steps to address it. First, we’ll need to block this card to prevent any further unauthorized transactions. Then, I can help you dispute the charge and issue a replacement card. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yes, that works. I just want to make sure this doesn’t happen again.

Agent: Absolutely, I understand your concern. Before we proceed, I’ll ask a few quick questions for our fraud team. Have you shared your card details, such as your card number, expiration date, or CVV code, with anyone recently?

Customer: No, I’m very careful with that.

Agent: That’s good to hear. It’s possible the information was compromised through other means, like an online breach. We’ll ensure your account is secure moving forward. I’ll go ahead and block the current card. This will prevent any new charges from being made on it.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Alright, your card has been successfully blocked. The next step is to file a dispute for the $50 charge. I’ll submit that for you now, and our fraud team will investigate. You’ll receive an update within 7 to 10 business days. In most cases, the funds are credited back to your account within that timeframe.

Customer: That’s good to know. So I don’t need to do anything further for the dispute?

Agent: Correct, we’ll handle it from here. You’ll receive an email confirmation shortly with the case number for your reference.

Customer: Got it. And about the replacement card—how long will that take to arrive?

Agent: We’ll send out your new card immediately. It should arrive within 5 to 7 business days. Would you like it sent to the same address we have on file, 123 Maple Street, Montreal, Quebec?

Customer: Yes, that address is fine.

Agent: Perfect. I’ve placed the order for your replacement card. It will come with a new card number, so any recurring payments you have set up will need to be updated.

Customer: Right, I’ll take care of that.

Agent: One more thing—would you like me to review your account for any other suspicious activity, just to be safe?

Customer: Yes, please. That would be great.

Agent: Sure thing. Give me just a moment... Okay, I’ve reviewed your recent transactions, and everything else looks normal. It seems like this was an isolated incident.

Customer: That’s a relief. Thanks for checking.

Agent: You’re welcome. To further protect your account, I’d recommend setting up transaction alerts. You can receive notifications for every purchase made with your card. Would you like me to enable that for you?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Agent: Great. I’ve set up alerts to notify you via email and text for any transactions made with your card. This way, you’ll know immediately if something looks off.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks for doing that.

Agent: No problem at all. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Roberts?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You’re very welcome. I’m sorry this happened, but I’m glad we were able to address it quickly. If you have any further questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call us. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Goodbye!
