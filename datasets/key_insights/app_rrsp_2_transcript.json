How can I assist you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, um, it\\u2019s me again\\u2026 Maria Santos. I\\u2026 I still can\\u2019t\\u2026 log in to the app. I\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong.\\n\\nRepresentative: Oh, hi again, Maria. I\\u2019m sorry to hear you\\u2019re still having trouble. Let\\u2019s figure this out. Are you using the new password we set up earlier, \\u201cWinter2024\\u201d?\\n\\nCustomer: Um, yes\\u2026 I think so? But\\u2026 it\\u2019s just not working. I\\u2026 I keep getting the same message. \\u201cInvalid login credentials.\\u201d\\n\\nRepresentative: Alright, let\\u2019s start fresh. Can you confirm if you\\u2019re entering the email associated with your account? Sometimes it helps to double-check for typos.\\n\\nCustomer: Oh\\u2026 uh\\u2026 I think so? I\\u2026 I used the one I always use\\u2026 maria.santos\\u2026@gmail.com?\\n\\nRepresentative: Hmm. The email on file is maria.santos85@gmail.com. Could that be the issue?\\n\\nCustomer: Oh\\u2026 um, maybe? I\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know.

I\\u2019ll unlock it for you. Hold on\\u2026 there we go. Try again now.\\n\\nCustomer: Uh, okay\\u2026 um\\u2026 still doesn\\u2019t work. I\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing wrong.\\n\\nRepresentative: Maria, let\\u2019s confirm your password again. Can you carefully re-enter \\u201cWinter2024\\u201d? Make sure the \\u201cW\\u201d is capitalized and there are no spaces before or after it.\\n\\nCustomer: Um, yes\\u2026 okay\\u2026 uh, I did that\\u2026 still\\u2026 still nothing. It\\u2019s the same error.\\n\\nRepresentative: (exhales) Alright. Let\\u2019s reset your password again. I\\u2019ll send another verification code. Let me know when you get it.\\n\\nCustomer: Oh\\u2026 okay\\u2026 um\\u2026 wait\\u2026 okay, I\\u2026 I have it. It\\u2019s 734920.\\n\\nRepresentative: Got it. Let me update that for you.

Are you sure you\\u2019re following the instructions exactly? Let\\u2019s try one more time.\\n\\nCustomer: I\\u2026 I think I am? I\\u2026 I\\u2019m really sorry, I\\u2026 I\\u2019m not good at\\u2026 this kind of thing. Can you\\u2026 just fix it?\\n\\nRepresentative: Maria, I\\u2019m trying my best to help you, but this requires you to log in yourself. Let\\u2019s do this step-by-step again. Open the app, enter your email maria.santos85@gmail.com, and type in Spring2024. What happens?\\n\\nCustomer: Um\\u2026 okay\\u2026 I\\u2026 I\\u2019m doing that\\u2026 oh\\u2026 uh, now it says \\u201cToo many attempts.\\u201d\\n\\nRepresentative: Alright, Maria. At this point, I\\u2019ll need to escalate this to our technical team. They can look deeper into your account settings. You\\u2019ll get a callback within 24 to 48 hours. Does that work?\\n\\nCustomer: Oh\\u2026 um\\u2026 okay, I guess. I\\u2019m sorry\\u2026 I\\u2026 I just\\u2026 don\\u2019t understand this stuff.\\n\\nRepresentative: It\\u2019s alright, Maria. Someone will reach out to resolve this. Is there anything else?\\n\\nCustomer: No\\u2026 I\\u2026 I guess that\\u2019s it. Thank you\\u2026\\n\\nRepresentative: You\\u2019re welcome. Have a good day.
